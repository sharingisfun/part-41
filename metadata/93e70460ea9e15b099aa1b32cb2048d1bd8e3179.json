Hundreds of Cocktails. A New Way to Drink.&quot;\n\nEnglish | ISBN: 076117494X | 2014 | EPUB | 416 pages | 10 MB\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a system, a tool kit, a recipe book. Beginning with one irresistible idea--a complete home bar of just 12 key bottles--hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how to make more than 200 classic and unique mixed drinks, including sours, slings, toddies, and highballs, plus the perfect Martini, the perfect Manhattan, and the perfect Mint Julep.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a surprising guide--tequila didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make the cut, and neither did bourbon, but genever did. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a literate guide--describing with great liveliness everything from the importance of vermouth and bitters (the Ã¢â‚¬Å“salt and pepperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of mixology) to the story of a punch bowl so big it was stirred by a boy in a rowboat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e70460ea9e15b099aa1b32cb2048d1bd8e3179","amp;dn":"The+12+Bottle+Bar%3A+A+Dozen+Bottles.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e70460ea9e15b099aa1b32cb2048d1bd8e3179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,231,4,96,234,158,21,176,153,170,27,50,203,32,72,209,189,142,49,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
