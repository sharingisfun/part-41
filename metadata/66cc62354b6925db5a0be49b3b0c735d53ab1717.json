Written by Christopher Nicholson; Adapted by Elizabeth Burke.\n\nIn the middle of the 18th century, a ship docks at Bristol with an extraordinary cargo: two young elephants. Bought by a wealthy landowner, they are taken to his estate in the English countryside. A stable boy, Tom Page, is given the task of caring for them. The Elephant Keeper is Tom's account of his life with the elephants. As the years pass, and as they journey across England, his relationship with the female elephant deepens in a startling manner. Along the way they meet incredulity, distrust and tragedy, and it is only their understanding of each other that keeps them together.\n\nTom .....Stuart McLoughlin\nLizzie .....Sarah Ovens\nMr Harrington .....Bertie Carvel\nMrs Harrington .....Claire Cage\nDr Chisholm .....Richard Mitchley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66cc62354b6925db5a0be49b3b0c735d53ab1717","amp;dn":"Christopher+Nicholson+-+The+Elephant+Keeper+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66cc62354b6925db5a0be49b3b0c735d53ab1717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,204,98,53,75,105,37,219,90,11,228,155,59,12,115,93,83,171,23,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
