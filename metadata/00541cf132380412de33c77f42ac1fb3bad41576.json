Parrish\n\n\n\nA deep freeze is bearing down on the Florida Everglades, the kind of brutal storm the locals call a killing rain. For Detective Louis Kincaid, the coldest night of the year has brought a terrifying new chill -- a grisly discovery that tightens his every nerve in warning. The body proves this is no routine case. It's the start of a nightmare. And when the killer chooses his next victim, there's no doubt the detective is matching wits with a predator who is as ruthless as they come. Now, with time running out, Kincaid is on a desperate hunt of his own, tracking a twisted adversary one step away from committing the ultimate horror.\n\n\n\nGenre: Mystery | Thriller | Suspense","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00541cf132380412de33c77f42ac1fb3bad41576","amp;dn":"P.J.+Parrish+-+A+Killing+Rain+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00541cf132380412de33c77f42ac1fb3bad41576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,84,28,241,50,56,4,18,222,51,199,127,66,172,31,179,186,212,21,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
