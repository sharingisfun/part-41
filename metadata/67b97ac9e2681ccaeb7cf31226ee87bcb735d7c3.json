Recorded between 1974 and 1985. Includes liner notes by Doug Haverty. All tracks have been digitally remastered. Though Supertramp eventually broke through in the US as radio-friendly pop-rockers, they started out in the prog-rock mode, turning out lengthy songs full of fanciful instrumental interludes. Even at their proggiest, though, they always interjected a discernible Beatlesque pop sensibility that kept them well away from the excesses often associated with prog rock.\n\nTHE VERY BEST OF SUPERTRAMP offers a handy career overview of the band&amp;#039;s stylistic evolution. &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; shows the group at its most expansive and conceptual, but the bulk of this collection is in fact occupied by concise, well-crafted tunes full of infectious melodies, propulsive keyboards, and the tasty interjections of John Anthony Helliwell&amp;#039;s saxophone. By the time they&amp;#039;d gotten around to their 1980s hit &quot;It&amp;#039;s Raining Again,&quot; Supertramp had fully transformed into a straight-ahead pop group, their McCartney-like tendencies coming fully to the fore. For most former art-rockers, this might have been a woeful development, but in the case of the already-popwise Supertramp, it was a blessing, making this anthology a pleasure all the way down the line.\n\n1997 collection featuring 15 of their absolute biggest &amp;best hits, all digitally remastered.
