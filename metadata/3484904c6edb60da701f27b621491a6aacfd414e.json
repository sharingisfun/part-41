The objective is to direct a flying bird, named &quot;Faby&quot;,[10] which moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the player touches the pipes, it ends the game. The bird briefly flaps upward each time the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, the bird falls due to gravity. The player is scored based on the number of pipe sets that the bird successfully passes through, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3484904c6edb60da701f27b621491a6aacfd414e","amp;dn":"Flappy+Bird+1.3+%5BJenu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3484904c6edb60da701f27b621491a6aacfd414e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,132,144,76,110,219,96,218,112,31,39,182,33,73,26,106,172,253,65,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
