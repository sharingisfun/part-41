You should not be using this as an\nend-user system. There will likely be many application compatibility\nissues and crashes involved. You've been warned, so proceed at your\nown discretion.\n\nI am uploading these so that as wide an audience as possible can\nhelp MS create the best OS they can with Windows 10. I don't make\nany money distributing these things either directly or indirectly.\n\nThe default Technical Preview and Enterprise Technical Preview are\navailable in 4 languages only: en-US, en-GB, zh-CN, and pt-BR\nAny other languages would likely need to be installed through the\ncontrol panel after install. There are no language packs available\nfor offline integration at this time, and likely will not be for\nthe duration of the technical preview. I have not tested the product\nyet. I have simply verified hashes and inspected files. If you find\nan issue with the product, try reporting it with the issue reporting\nthing.
