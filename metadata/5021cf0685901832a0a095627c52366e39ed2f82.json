Erica says her mother, Jackie, looked the other way when she was being molested as a child Ã¢â‚¬â€ a claim Jackie denies. Erica faces her mom for the first time in five years. Can they put the past in the past? And, Karen meets the recipient of her deceased daughter, KyleighÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, heart. Plus, best-selling author Mitch Albom shares advice on how to stop wasting time Ã¢â‚¬â€ and start living life!\n\nPainful Past\n\nErica says she hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spoken to or seen her mother, Jackie, in more than five years. Ã¢â‚¬Å“She is a selfish person, a drug addict, evil Ã¢â‚¬â€ if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something stronger than hate, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the way I feel [about my mother],Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Erica says. She claims that as a child, she tried telling her mom that she was being molested, but it fell on deaf ears Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the molestation continued for four years, occurring every other day.\n\nOne Life Lost, Another Saved\n\nKaren says her life was changed in the blink of an eye when her 21-year-old daughter, Kyleigh, was killed in an attempted robbery on May 26, 2010 Ã¢â‚¬â€ and she was faced with the difficult task of donating her daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organs.\n\nAt the same time Karen and her family were preparing to donate KyleighÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organs, another woman, Dawn, was dying of heart disease and in need of a transplant. Dawn says at age 34, she was planning her funeral and was near death when she received KyleighÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart.\n\nType: TV Rip\nVideo format: MPEG-4 (MP4)\nAudio format: AAC 2ch stereo\nApproximate runtime: 42 minutes\nGenre: talk show\nAustralian air date: 11th November, 2013\n\n(commercials and promos removed)\n\n+includes MPC-HC thumbs+\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://drphil.com/shows/show/1934&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://drphil.com/shows/show/1934&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* please seed as much as possible after downloading to help keep this alive *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5021cf0685901832a0a095627c52366e39ed2f82","amp;dn":"Dr+Phil+Show+-+Time+Does+Not+Heal+All+Wounds+%5B11-11-2013%5D+%7BOZFox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5021cf0685901832a0a095627c52366e39ed2f82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,33,207,6,133,144,24,50,160,160,149,98,124,82,54,110,57,237,47,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
