The four-parts Canadian, one-part\nArkansan quintet's sophomore effort boasts more soon-to-be-staples than any other Band studio recording, what with the likes of the Joan Baez hit &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,&quot; &quot;Across the Great Divide,&quot; and &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; standing out among the dozen uniformly memorable tracks. Lesser-known group originals such as the achingly lovely &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; and the cryptic &quot;Unfaithful Servant,&quot; however, play crucial roles in giving this 1969 classic its unique flavor. Given the high standard established by The Band and its better-still 1968 predecessor, Music from Big Pink, it's not surprising the Band peaked early as a recording group. As with all the 2000 Band reissues, this remastered reissue boasts a number of bonus tracks, though all but\n&quot;Get Up Jake&quot; are alternate takes of album selections. --Steven Stolder\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Across the great divide                              [02:54]\n02.Rag mama rag                                         [03:05]\n03.The night they drove old dixie down                  [03:33]\n04.When you awake                                       [03:13]\n05.Up on cripple creek                                  [04:35]\n06.Whispering pines                                     [03:58]\n07.Jemima surrender                                     [03:32]\n08.Rockin' chair                                        [03:43]\n09.Look out cleveland                                   [03:10]\n10.Jawbone                                              [04:21]\n11.The unfaithful servant                               [04:17]\n12.King harvest (has surely come)                       [03:40]\n13.Get up jake (outtake, stereo)                        [02:18]\n14.Rag mama rag (alt. vocal take, rough mx)             [03:05]\n15.The night they drove old dixie down (alt. mx)        [04:16]\n16.Up on cripple creek (alt. take)                      [04:55]\n17.Whispering pines (alt. take)                         [05:07]\n18.Jemima surrender (alt. take)                         [03:49]\n19.King harvest (has surely come) (alt. perf.)
