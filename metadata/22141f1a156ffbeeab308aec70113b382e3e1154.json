The daughter of a grifting team, Ellie spent her childhood being used as a pawn in her parents' latest scam. Now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much older, wiser and ready to give her con artist life a rest. But returning to the dry desert town of Palm Valley, California means one more temptation than she bargained for Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Camden McQueen. Once known as the high school weirdo, Camden is bigger and badder than the boy he used to be and a talented tattoo artist with his own thriving business. EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s counting on Camden still being in love with her but what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not counting on is how easily unrequited love can turn into obsession over time. When Camden discovers EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan to con him, he makes her a deal she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dare refuse, but her freedom comes with a price and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one that takes both Ellie and Camden down a dangerous road.\n\n\n***The Artists Trilogy is a dark and sexy contemporary ride about three flawed individuals caught in a world where it's so easy to justify the bad things we do. This is a pure adult read (Not YA or NA).\n\nThis is the 1st book in the trilogy. It is followed by the novella On Every Street (released in March 2013) and the sequel Shooting Scars (released in May 2013). The third and final book in the series will also be released in 2013.***\n\nFor Kindle Readers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22141f1a156ffbeeab308aec70113b382e3e1154","amp;dn":"Sins+%26amp%3B+Needles+-+Karina+Halle+Mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22141f1a156ffbeeab308aec70113b382e3e1154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,20,31,26,21,111,251,238,171,48,138,236,112,17,59,56,46,62,17,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
