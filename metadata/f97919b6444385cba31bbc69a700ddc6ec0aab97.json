The original cover depicted Clark and his adoptive father outside the Kent farmhouse apparently holding what may be beer.\nDC issued a statement to retailers that the issue was recalled, and that any copies featuring the original cover be destroyed. The next week, DC reprinted the issue featuring a cover in which the label on the bottle was changed to read, &quot;soda pop.&quot; This was the second such instance of censorship invoked by DC that month, the first plaguing issue #10 of Frank Miller and Jim Lee's All Star Batman and Robin for insufficient censorship of profanity within the issue.\n\n\nTracked by http://comicpirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97919b6444385cba31bbc69a700ddc6ec0aab97","amp;dn":"Superman+-+Brainiac+Story-Arc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f97919b6444385cba31bbc69a700ddc6ec0aab97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,121,25,182,68,67,133,203,163,27,188,105,167,0,221,198,236,10,171,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
