A team of\nJesuits exorcized her for eight weeks. The priests announced that they had\nexpelled 12,652 demons from her, demons that her grandmother had kept\nas flies in glass jars. The grapdmother was tortured into confessing that she\nwas a witch who had engaged in sex with Satan. She was then burned at the\nstake. This was one of perhaps one million such executions during three\ncenturies of witch-hunts.\n\nIn 1989 in Moradabad, India, a pig caused hundreds of people to kill one\nanother when the animal walked through a Muslim holy ground. Muslims, who\nthink pigs are an embodiment of Satan, accused Hindus of driving the pig\ninto the sacred spot. Members of both faiths went on a rampage, stabbing and\nclubbing. The pig riot spread to a dozen cities and left two hundred dead.\nA squad of armed Islamic zealots raided a Christian church at Behawalpur,\nPakistan, on October 28, 2001, killing the minister, fourteen worshipers,\nand the church's police guard.\n\nIt is said that there is never enough religion in the world to make people\nlove one another-just enough to make them hate one another. Incendiary\nblends of fundamentalist religion, politics, nationalism, and ethnic zealotry\nengender countless examples of atrocity in the name of faith and orthodoxy.\nIf anything, religious persecution is more savage now than ever before in\nthe history of mankind.\n\nHoly Horrors chronicles the grim spectrum of religious persecution from\nancient times to the present. Fully illustrated with drawings, woodcuts, and\nphotographs, the book recounts such historic religious persecution as the\nCrusades, the Islamic jihads, the Catholic wars against heretics, the Inquisition,\nwitch-hunts, and the Reformation. It also chronicles modern-day atrocities,\nincluding the Holocaust, the seemingly insoluble Catholic-Protestant\nschism in Northern Ireland, religious tribalism in Lebanon, and the barbaric\ncruelty of the theocracy in Iran.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a35c88d3f9f926494e53ef6d2b7d3b7a0d85068","amp;dn":"Holy+Horrors+by+James+Haught","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a35c88d3f9f926494e53ef6d2b7d3b7a0d85068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,53,200,141,63,159,146,100,148,229,62,246,210,183,211,183,160,216,80,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
