Information on the tapes from which these came follows:\n\nThe Book of Mormon Seminar\n\nAll but three tapes are live recordings from a seminar given in Snowflake Arizona, August 10, 11, 12 - 1989.\n\nTapes 1, 2 and 17 were added by Hyrum at a later date to supplement the set.\n\ntape 1 - A new dispensation opens (43:05)\ntape 2 - missing.\ntape 3 - The meaning of Gethsemane (1:27:29)\nTape 4 - The meaning of Calvary (1:17:53)\ntape 5 - The 13 looks of Nephi, Christ's redemption from the fall\nHA's wife, Helen Mae is the speaker for the first 1:04:45 of tape5.

I've edited out this narration and merged the two sides together. You'll notice a slight break in speech at these points (typically about 40 minutes in ... 1/2 the time noted in the links). \n\n\n\nThe Doctrine and Covenants Seminar\n\nThere was no introductory information on the first tape. It becomes clear that this seminar was also in Snowflake.\nThe year 1991 was used in a context that indicates this was the year this conference took place.\n\ntape 1 - A volume of modern scripture (1:23:55)\ntape 2 - The role of the living Prophet (1:25:21)\ntape 3 - The new witness for Christ (1:28:40)\ntape 4 - The idea of Zion (1:25:21 78.15mb)\ntape 5 - The prophetic vision of Zion - part 1 (1:22:41)\ntape 6 - part 2 (1:19:11)\ntape 7 - The Temple, the eternal family of Christ (1:27:13)\ntape 8 - Saviors on Mount Zion (1:14:34)\nTape 9 - The Church of Jesus Christ and the mission (1:28:40)\ntape 10 - The peaceful millennial Kingdom of Christ (1:22:44)\ntape 11 - The three divisions of Christ's coming - part 1 (1:23:19)\ntape 12 - part 2 (1:20:12)\ntape 13 - Jesus Christ, the great creator and redeemer (1:26:30)\ntape 14 - Man and his relationship to God (1:19:51)\ntape 15 - Resurrection and three degrees of glory - part 1 (1:20:24)\ntape 16 - part 2 (1:29:56)\ntape 17 - Great harvest season of last days - part 1 (1:22:56)\ntape 18 - part 2 (1:27:27)\nit appears that tape 18 was the end of the Snowflake seminar. \nnot sure where the following tapes were given/made\n\nfirst three appear to be in Hyrum's stake\ntape 19 - Youth, repentance and Jesus Christ (0:51:42)\ntape 20 - The doctrine of the fall (1:01:07)\ntape 21 - Doctrine of spirit rebirth - basic plan of life - Moses 6 (0:58:18)\ntape 22 - Doctrine of Election (1:18:27)\ntape 23 - Power of resurrection and atonement (1:12:53)\ntape 24 - Consecration and stewardship (0:14:29 13:)\n\n\n\nThe Pearl of Great Price Seminar:\n\nThere was no introductory information on the first tape, other than its apparent this seminar was also in Snowflake. I'm assuming it was within a year, plus or minus of the BoM seminar of August, 1989.\n\ntape 1 -The Idea of the Temple in the Pearl of Great Price (1:57:48)\ntape 2 - part 2 (0:7:26) appended to tape 1\ntape 3 - Knowing God through the Pearl of Great Price (1:26:39)\ntape 4 - Christ's Appearances to his prophets(1:46:41)\ntape 5 - The creations of God - Worlds without Number - part 1(1:33:32)\ntape 6 - part 2 (0:28:39)\ntape 7 - The fall of Adam and the natural man (1:16:03)\ntape 8 - Christ and his infinite atonement (1:55:39)\ntape 9 - part 2 had about 5 minutes of questions from tape8 - appended to tape 8\ntape 10 - The new birth and growing up in Christ (2:10:03)\ntape 11 - part 2 had about 15 minutes which was appended to tape 10\ntape 12 - Pre-Earth Life (1:06:59)\ntape 13 - The Zion of Enoch (1:29:09)\ntape 14 - Zion through the ages (1:28:52)\ntape 15 - The Second Coming of Christ (2:08:05)\ntape 16 - part 2 - appended to tape 15\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ffff87967915f96d1033829bd90b8d6e617b938","amp;dn":"Hyrum+Andrus+Lectures+%28LDS+or+Mormon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ffff87967915f96d1033829bd90b8d6e617b938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,255,248,121,103,145,95,150,209,3,56,41,189,144,184,214,230,23,185,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
