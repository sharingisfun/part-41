With some 98 percent of the state suffering from a water crisis, California Gov. Jerry Brown ordered residents and businesses to cut water use by 25 percent. It is the first mandatory statewide reduction in CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history. One group not facing restrictions is big agriculture, which uses about 80 percent of CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s water. According to The Pacific Institute, 47 percent of a CaliforniansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ water footprint is in meat and dairy products. We are joined by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn, directors of the documentary, &quot;Cowspiracy: the Sustainability Secret.&quot; The film contends livestock is the leading cause of deforestation, water consumption and pollution despite many environmental organizationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ relative silence on the issue.\n\n  (Put there by D.J.Tone, of the East Village, Manhattan.
