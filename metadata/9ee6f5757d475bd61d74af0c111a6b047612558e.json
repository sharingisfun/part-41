Tracks is an easy-to-love collection of catchy songs that will have you playing Ã¢â‚¬Å“guess the influenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ these songs are so good because they will remind you of other bands, well at first anyway.\n\nOpening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Election DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“KnucklesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sound pulled right off of EelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Daisies of the Galaxy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sally AnnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I Forget To Say I Love YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Credits RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ clearly have a Wilco slant that would not of sounded out-of-place on Being There. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not saying these songs are bad in any way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they are particularly fun and have some really loose arrangements that are always on point.\n\nNow, to the part I love the most; after Ã¢â‚¬Å“Credits RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the band, to me, sounds different. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Answer AnymoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds uniquely Long Distance Runners. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Answer AnymoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ blends perfectly into album highlight Ã¢â‚¬Å“The IslandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where the originality continues with its time signature twists that keep you guessing. Instrumental track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Up The RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ puts you into that auditory environment and is another nice transition into Ã¢â‚¬Å“He DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Stare into The Sun No MoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a country-soul-pop number that is pure ear-candy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Short History of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ends the record with a slowly building rock groove built on layers of organ and piano parts as the whole band comes together with soaring harmonies that drives the whole vibe of the record home.\n\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder version 20120407 (140.0)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz12/elitter/fd0138fdb1-1.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz12/elitter/fd0138fdb1-1.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee6f5757d475bd61d74af0c111a6b047612558e","amp;dn":"The+Long+Distance+Runners...Tracks%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee6f5757d475bd61d74af0c111a6b047612558e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,230,245,117,125,71,91,214,29,116,175,12,17,26,107,4,118,18,85,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
