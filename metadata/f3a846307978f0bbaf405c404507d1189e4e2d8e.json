He said, &quot;Tomorrow night, it's time to restore opportunity for all.&quot; Wow, I wish he'd just stop regulating opportunities away.\n\nALL-STAR PANEL: I will be joined by a politician who I wish would get to give the State of the Union address... former Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, along with Independent Women's Forum's Hadley Heath and The National Review's Charles Cooke. They will discuss the State of the Union speech through a lens of liberty.\n\nRIGHT AND LEFT LIBERTARIANS: Deroy Murdock, a nationally syndicated columnist, and Thaddeus Russell, author of A Renegade History of the United States, will discuss the right and the left Libertarian views on the State of the Union.\n\nKRONIES: President Obama will undoubtedly call for more government programs to fix problems he sees. Often this involves &quot;investments&quot; in things like green energy, which has been a recipe for cronyism. I will talk to John Papola, the producer of the &quot;Kronies&quot; video.\n\nMY STATE OF THE UNION: I will give the State of the Union speech that I wish President Obama would give.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a846307978f0bbaf405c404507d1189e4e2d8e","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.02.02.%5BState+of+the+Union%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a846307978f0bbaf405c404507d1189e4e2d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,168,70,48,121,120,240,187,175,64,92,64,69,7,209,24,158,78,45,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
