Simply put, beliefs come first and explanations for beliefs follow. \nThe brain, Shermer argues, is a belief engine. From sensory data flowing in through the senses, the brain naturally begins to look for and \nfind patterns, and then infuses those patterns with meaning. Our brains connect the dots of our world into meaningful patterns \nthat explain why things happen, and these patterns become beliefs. Once beliefs are formed the brain begins to look for and \nfind confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, which accelerates the process of reinforcing them, and round and \nround the process goes in a positive-feedback loop of belief confirmation. Shermer outlines the numerous cognitive tools our brains engage to reinforce our beliefs as truths.\nInterlaced with his theory of belief, Shermer provides countless real-world examples of how this process operates, \nfrom politics, economics, and religion to conspiracy theories, the supernatural, and the paranormal. Ultimately, \nhe demonstrates why science is the best tool ever devised to determine whether or not a belief matches reality.\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2945c0fa96174b9775f56a6f065b133f7d2462f5","amp;dn":"The+Believing+Brain-+From+Ghosts+and+Gods+to+Politics+and+Conspi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2945c0fa96174b9775f56a6f065b133f7d2462f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,69,192,250,150,23,75,151,117,245,106,111,6,91,19,63,125,36,98,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
