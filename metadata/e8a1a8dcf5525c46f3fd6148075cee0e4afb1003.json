Now 23, the L.A. singer bucks the WWJD&amp;#039;ers with a debut \nfull of mall-punky, grrrl-power tunes produced by Glen Ballard (Alanis \nMorissette) and Dr. Luke (Avril Lavigne). But her attention-grabbing doesn&amp;#039;t \nfeel very rebellious: On the New Wave-y club single &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ a \nvanilla recounting of her chick-on-chick exploits Ã¢â‚¬â€ she sounds like the type who \nmakes out with her BFF just to get a dude&amp;#039;s attention. And when she&amp;#039;s not acting \nout, she&amp;#039;s a total snooze. &quot;Mannequin,&quot; a lament about a guy who&amp;#039;s too stoic \n(&quot;You&amp;#039;re not a man, you&amp;#039;re just a mannequin!&quot;), recalls Cher&amp;#039;s Eighties catalog. \nAnd the acoustic ode &quot;Thinking of You,&quot; which compares an unrequited lover to \n&quot;an Indian summer in the middle of winter,&quot; is generic Dawson&amp;#039;s Creek schlock. \nYes, Perry has a heart, but it sounds like her bustier&amp;#039;s too tight for her to \nuse it. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a1a8dcf5525c46f3fd6148075cee0e4afb1003","amp;dn":"Katy+Perry-One+Of+The+Boys+%282008%29+%5BMp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a1a8dcf5525c46f3fd6148075cee0e4afb1003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,161,168,220,245,82,92,70,243,253,97,72,7,92,238,14,74,251,16,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
