Aggravated that he has been used as a decoy, he is faced with the prospect of being killed by Yoshida-San's (ToshirÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ Mifune) brother, Hideo. Instead, he is advised to infiltrate Yoshida's samurai school and obtain the sword. He does so, yet finds himself being drawn into the ways of Japanese etiquette and tradition to the point where he returns the sword to Yoshida himself after having the perfect opportunity to escape with it. The sword (one of a pair known as &quot;The Equals&quot;) was a family heirloom, passed down through the generations, and had been lost during World War II. It was finally tracked down in California where Yoshiida's son, Toshio, finds it and tracks down someone to act as a decoy in order to safely smuggle it into Japan, and back to its rightful owner, Yoshida-San.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:628ecbc60a5d4ffb07bc9ba141bbe37957804b0b","amp;dn":"The+Challenge+%281982%29+-+VHSRip+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"628ecbc60a5d4ffb07bc9ba141bbe37957804b0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,142,203,198,10,93,79,251,7,188,155,161,65,187,227,121,87,128,75,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
