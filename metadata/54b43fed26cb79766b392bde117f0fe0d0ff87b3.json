While Undertow made the band popular, Ãƒâ€ nima made them a phenomenon. The album stunned audiences in 1996 and brought the avant-garde to the mainstream. Complex instrumental passages echoed Pink Floyd. Cryptic lyrics rewarded thoughtful listening. And the band?s intense performances were decidedly metal. Ãƒâ€ nima launched Tool into their own universe. Ten years later, it is still a worthwhile visit.\n\nThe String Quartet Tribute to Tool?s Ãƒâ€ nima is a breathtaking journey through Tool?s masterpiece. A handpicked group of musicians have used violins, viola, and cello to explore the emotional depths of such songs as &quot;Forty-Six &amp; 2&quot; and &quot;Third Eye.&quot; Each movement of the bow elicits moody and nuanced notes. These string interpretations prove that Tool are truly modern day composers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54b43fed26cb79766b392bde117f0fe0d0ff87b3","amp;dn":"The+String+Quartet+Tribute+To+Tool%5C%27s+Aenima","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54b43fed26cb79766b392bde117f0fe0d0ff87b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,180,63,237,38,203,121,118,107,57,43,222,17,127,15,224,208,255,135,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
