She sings as though this one ordinary incident has unraveled her world -- she sounds weary and tense, puzzled by a sudden lack of bravery, haunted by what could have been, overcome with regret. Jones takes her sweet time illuminating these emotional ripples, and the restraint makes that track -- and all of Come Away With Me -- a quietly captivating triumph of torch song. Her voice might be set to permanent smolder, but the Dallas-born singer, whose father is Ravi Shankar, doesn&amp;#039;t act like your typical cabaret diva: She understands the desolate hurt of Hank Williams (&quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; is one of the album&amp;#039;s most effective covers) and the gloomy melancholy of Billie Holiday, knows her way around the late-night moans of Memphis soul and the veiled desire of tango (&quot;I&amp;#039;ve Got to See You Again&quot; echoes the dance&amp;#039;s slithering sensuality). Yet for all this gathering of handed-down wisdom, and all the distinct shades of blue that color her interpretations, Jones rarely sounds like a slick purveyor of saloon heartbreak. She sings in an earthy growl that can send chills, or a conspiratorial whisper that suggests she&amp;#039;s sharing sworn secrets, or a weary sigh that exudes the kind of quiet, easygoing intimacy that doesn&amp;#039;t come around in songs too much anymore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acea643b4032f547809140bae39f88a749126cc6","amp;dn":"Norah+Jones+-+Come+Away+with+Me+%5B2002%5D%28++sidthefish++%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acea643b4032f547809140bae39f88a749126cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,234,100,59,64,50,245,71,128,145,64,186,227,159,136,167,73,18,108,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
