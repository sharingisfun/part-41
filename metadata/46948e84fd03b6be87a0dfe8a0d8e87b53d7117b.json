Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe RevÃƒÂ¶lution By Night is the ninth studio album by the American hard rock band Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult, released in 1983.\n\nThe album was intended to capitalize on the unexpected success of Fire of Unknown Origin just two years prior, hence the album's blend of straight-ahead rock and pop elements. This was the first album by the band not to feature all of the band's classic members, drummer Albert Bouchard having been fired during the previous tour.\n\n&quot;Shooting Shark&quot; became a radio hit, and its accompanying video became one of MTV's most requested clips upon its release. The lyrics to &quot;Shooting Shark&quot; were based on a poem by Patti Smith. The song &quot;Take Me Away,&quot; co-written by Eric Bloom with Canadian rock musician Aldo Nova, also received significant airplay on AOR radio. Nonetheless, the album failed to go Gold in the United States.\n\n\n\n\nBand Members:\n\n\nEric Bloom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, lead vocals on tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 7\n\nDonald 'Buck Dharma' Roeser Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, keyboards, lead vocals on tracks 3, 4, 8, mixing (uncredited) [5]\n\nAllen Lanier Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano, keyboards\n\nJoe Bouchard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, electric and acoustic guitars, vocoder, lead vocals on 9\n\nRick Downey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Musicians:\n\n\nLarry Fast - synthesizers, programming\n\nAldo Nova Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar and synthesizers on &quot;Take Me Away&quot;\n\nGregg Winter - backing vocals on &quot;Eyes on Fire&quot;\n\nRandy Jackson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass on &quot;Shooting Shark&quot;\n\nMarc Baum - saxophone on &quot;Shooting Shark&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46948e84fd03b6be87a0dfe8a0d8e87b53d7117b","amp;dn":"B.O.C.+-+The+Revolution+By+Night+%5B1983%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46948e84fd03b6be87a0dfe8a0d8e87b53d7117b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,148,142,132,253,3,182,190,135,160,223,232,160,216,232,123,83,215,17,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
