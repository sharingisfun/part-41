The first edition was published in 1965. It is largely a revision of the American Standard Version of 1901, with reference made to various texts in the original languages. It is designed to &quot;amplify&quot; the text by using a system of punctuation and other typographical features to bring out all shades of meaning present in the original texts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da78368c3e0a031e75e6e121234d9eb9fb3fe09a","amp;dn":"The+Amplified+Bible+AMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da78368c3e0a031e75e6e121234d9eb9fb3fe09a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,120,54,140,62,10,3,30,117,230,225,33,35,77,158,185,251,63,224,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
