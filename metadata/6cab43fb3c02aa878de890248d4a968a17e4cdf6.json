The movie tells the heart wrenching stories from the lives of those women who survived the church-run Magdalene Laundries\n\n&quot;The Forgotten Maggies&quot; was officially launched that the Galway Film Festival in 2009. It was aired also aired at the Cantor Film Center, in New York, where it met a standing ovation.\n\nIt was praised as a compelling, brave and honest piece of work. Subsequently to that, the Magdalene women who featured in the original documentary went on to meet officials at the Department of Justice in Ireland for the first time. This eventually set the ball rolling for everything else that followed in terms of their campaign and getting international recognition.\n\n-----------------\n------------------Since 2009 the documentary has been changed due to legal issues. Now it includes survivor's testimonies, from over seven Magdalene women and explores in depth the now infamous High Park exhumation where 155 Magdalene women were exhumed in 1993.\n\nThe documentary looks at shedding new light on the how and why innocent girls ended up in these institutions working against their will, some as young as 12-years-old. It challenges the Irish Government and questions the States role with regard these institutions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Forgotten MaggiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the only Irish made documentary on the subject matter and while people feel they know the stories of the Magdalene laundries nobody could be prepared for what these women have got to say and tell.\n\nEach of these women were promised a better education and better employment opportunities. None of these women ever imagined they would be kept as prisoners, against their will, forced into slave labour, while the Religious Orders made a huge profit on the illegal work they carried out, all in the name of Charity. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Forgotten MaggiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a must see for anyone that wants to fully understand what these women have suffered and the role played by both Church and State.\n\nFile Info:\nComplete name                            : Magdalene Laundries [RTE Ireland] HQ PDTV x264 AC3 DeViL303.mkv\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFile size                                : 559 MiB\nDuration                                 : 52mn 11s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 496 Kbps\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2013-02-22 12:51:37\nWriting application                      : mkvmerge v2.5.3 ('Boogie') built on Mar  7 2009 15:00:41\nWriting library                          : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;430b2a242b030f706d73&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 3 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 52mn 11s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 1 303 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 12.0 Mbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nOriginal display aspect ratio            : 5:4\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nStandard                                 : PAL\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.126\nStream size                              : 476 MiB (85%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 93 r1542M 5b86182\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : A_AC3\nDuration                                 : 52mn 11s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 71.7 MiB (13%)\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cab43fb3c02aa878de890248d4a968a17e4cdf6","amp;dn":"Magdalene+Laundries+REPACK+%5BRTE+Ireland%5D+HQ+PDTV+x264+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cab43fb3c02aa878de890248d4a968a17e4cdf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,171,67,251,60,2,170,135,141,232,144,36,141,74,150,138,23,228,205,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
