Inspired by Scandinavian acts such as Sigur RÃƒÂ³s and MÃƒÂºm, she began making music in her teens, and studied piano and composition at the Icelandic Art Academy in 2007. During that time she also played and sang with Seabear and Sin Fang, though at first she was afraid to sing too close to the microphone. She overcame that fear with experience and began work on her solo project, issuing her debut EP, Theater Island, on Morr Music in 2010. The following year, her first album, the more fleshed-out We Sink, arrived.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ed494a52412227b6a26b5597a20a4cdbf1f92c","amp;dn":"Soley+-+Theater+Island+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ed494a52412227b6a26b5597a20a4cdbf1f92c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,237,73,74,82,65,34,39,182,162,107,85,151,162,10,76,219,241,249,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
