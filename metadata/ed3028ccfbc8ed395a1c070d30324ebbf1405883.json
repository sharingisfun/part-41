It was offered for free by lightscribe.com but unfortunately not anymore (replaced by their own software, which is IMO inferior), so I decided to upload it. It is far better than Nero or other labeling programs I tried - very simple and intuitive. In fact it is a trimmed version of SureThing CD/DVD Labeler but just limited to LightScribe labeling (ink labeling is not possible). LightScribe labeling can be pleasant and hassle free.\n\nAlready made covers can be found on LightScribeCovers dot com or CDCovers dot cc\n\nI also attached the newest lightscribe driver. It is all you need for LS labeling.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed3028ccfbc8ed395a1c070d30324ebbf1405883","amp;dn":"SureThing+Express+4.3+SE+%28LightScribe+labeling+software%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed3028ccfbc8ed395a1c070d30324ebbf1405883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,48,40,204,251,200,237,57,90,28,7,13,48,50,78,187,241,64,88,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
