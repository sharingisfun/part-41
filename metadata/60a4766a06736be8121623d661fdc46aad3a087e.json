Ballard; from the enduring legacies of Thomas Jefferson and George Orwell to the persistent agonies of anti-Semitism and jihad. Hitchens even looks at the recent financial crisis and argues for arthe enduring relevance of Karl Marx.\n\nThe book forms a bridge between the two parallel enterprises of culture and politics. It reveals how politics justifies itself by culture, and how the latter prompts the former. In this fashion, ARGUABLY burnishes Christopher Hitchens' credentials as-to quote Christopher Buckley-our &quot;greatest living essayist in the English language.&quot;\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60a4766a06736be8121623d661fdc46aad3a087e","amp;dn":"Arguably%3A+Essays+by+Christopher+Hitchens++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60a4766a06736be8121623d661fdc46aad3a087e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,164,118,106,6,115,107,232,18,22,35,214,97,253,196,106,173,58,8,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
