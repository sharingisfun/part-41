These are the two &quot;systems&quot; that support us; we might call them the &quot;self-reliance system&quot; and the &quot;organization system&quot;. The former tends to breed selfreliant\nmen and women; the latter tends to produce organization men and women. \n\nAll existing societies support themselves by a mixture of the two systems; but the proportions Vary. In the modern world, during the last hundred years or so, there has been an enormous and historically unique shift: away from self-reliance and towards organization. As a result people are becoming less self-reliant and more dependent than has ever been seen in history. \n\nPeople may claim to be more highly educated than any generation before them; but the fact remains that they cannot really do anything for themselves. They depend utterly on vastly complex organizations, on fantastic machinery, on larger and larger money incomes. What if there is a hold-up, a breakdown, a strike, or unemployment?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:538b2041a965d4bb0bf2354abe0f1d1de5d09239","amp;dn":"he+Complete+Book+of+Self+Sufficiency+-+John+Seymour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"538b2041a965d4bb0bf2354abe0f1d1de5d09239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,139,32,65,169,101,212,187,11,242,53,74,190,15,29,29,229,208,146,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
