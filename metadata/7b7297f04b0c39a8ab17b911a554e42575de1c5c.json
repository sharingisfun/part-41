The file continually goes in and out of sync &amp; adjusts quality. This doesn't have anything to do with the rip or conversion, it seems to be the web player. Anyway this is all we've got sadly. They didn't archive this After Show episode so it's just gone now.\n\nI'm trying something new. I'm changing the container from MKV to MP4. I'm also limiting the file size to 50MB. That seems like a reasonable size for a 10~ minute file.\n\nSD. widescreen. Recorded with Replay Video Catcher from FoxBusiness.com. Converted with AviDemux using Mpeg4 AVC (x264) &amp; AAC (Faac). Video was a two pass encode with the file size limited to 50MB. Resized to 720x404 &amp; cropped. The black bars on the sides that come and go are due to the web player I rip these from. Thanks goes out to Philandrist for ripping the show proper. Also from the image I used.\n\nI have nothing to do with the scene, I just admire their naming standards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7297f04b0c39a8ab17b911a554e42575de1c5c","amp;dn":"The.Independents.After.Show.2014.08.18.WS.WEB-DL.x264.XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7297f04b0c39a8ab17b911a554e42575de1c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,114,151,240,75,12,57,168,171,23,185,17,165,84,228,37,117,222,28,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
