Death takes us when it is ready. Nineteen-year-old Mora knows this all too well, living in a world where the dead have walked the Earth for the past 60 years.\n\nMora is on a mission to save her village from the relentless greyskins, and there is only one man that can help her: Jeremiah of Screven. As she travels the wastelands, she discovers a power within herself, a power she believes no other human possesses. That is, until she meets others like her Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the ones who call themselves the Starborn.\n\nThese super-humans are on a mission also: to destroy the undead greyskins, and take down the greedy Jeremiah. Mora must now choose between the one who can keep her family safe, and those that can show her who she truly is.\n\nIf It Kills Me\n\nOverconfidence has no place in a world where the dead rule. Nineteen-year-old Mora has learned this the hard way. After a conflict in the colony of Salem that left hundreds of people dead, Mora and her Starborn allies have been branded as fugitives by Jeremiah, the leader of Screven.\n\nNow, Mora must prove to the world that she isn't the enemy, and that hope for the future lies with the Starborns, not Jeremiah. To do that, she must find out the truth behind the origins of the dreaded greyskins that roam the Earth, attacking villages relentlessly.\n\nBut more than that, she must protect her family. The Starborns attempt to set up a base at her home, Springhill, but it only brings more turmoil. With a mentor channeling her dreams of the past, and two rival brothers fighting for her love, Mora learns of a new enemy that threatens to bring them down before the revolution can even begin.\n\nEven In Death\n\nGreen, you're clean. Red, you're dead.\n\nNineteen-year-old Mora is haunted by the flashing red light that pronounces her doom. Now she knows she only has about twenty-four hours to defeat Jeremiah and finish the revolution she has started, before the greyskin virus claims her life.\n\nTo do this, she must lead the other Starborns through the war-torn streets of Screven. But Jeremiah has a secret power that will test Mora in ways she could have never imagined.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:550f39ba22674f4acf837f06b1d76315db186ec0","amp;dn":"The+Starborn+Saga+%28Books+1%2C+2%2C+%26amp%3B+3%29+-+Jason+D.+Morrow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"550f39ba22674f4acf837f06b1d76315db186ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,15,57,186,34,103,79,74,207,131,127,6,177,215,99,21,219,24,110,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
