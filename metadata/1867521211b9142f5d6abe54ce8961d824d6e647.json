Advanced Free Radical Reactions for Organic Synthesis reviews information on all types of practical radical reactions, e.g. cyclizations, additions, hydrogen-atom abstractions, decarboxylation reactions. The book usefully provides experimental details for the most important reactions as well as numerous references to the original literature. By covering both the fundamentals and synthetic applications it is therefore suitable for both new and experienced researchers, chemists, biochemists, natural product chemists and graduate students. This title is the definitive guide to radical chemistry for all scientists.\r\n\r\n- Introduces and reviews the use of radicals to perform synthetic transformations.\r\n- Practical details are provided for the most important methods.\r\n- Numerous references to the original literature","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1867521211b9142f5d6abe54ce8961d824d6e647","amp;dn":"Advanced+Free+Radical+Reactions+for+Organic+Synthesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1867521211b9142f5d6abe54ce8961d824d6e647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,103,82,18,17,185,20,47,93,106,190,84,206,137,97,216,36,214,230,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
