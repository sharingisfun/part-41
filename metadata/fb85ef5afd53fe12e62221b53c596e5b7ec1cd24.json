The traumatic guitar solos of Pink Floyd and the stylings of trap/EDM, serve as the core inspiration for his most recent EP, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DelaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. His productions dabble in the realm of ambiance over chopped vocal samples, provoking a sense of inner peace in the listener.\n\nDakota makes use of the dead space found in-between the samples, serving as a tool to create forced groove. Groove is something long lost to the EDM scene. He uses simplistic kits to convey a familiar wave of comfort, but allows the pitched vocal samples to tug at the stability of the audience.\n\nWhat truly makes music timeless Ã¢â‚¬â€œ any music, genre or style Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is feeling. Ã¢â‚¬Å“DelaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is pure feeling and depth. It is amazingly organic, thick, and warm. It takes your mind through the fractal scheme of time and space, into the void yet at the same time into complete fullness. It is utterly spine chilling, and so powerful.\n\nSome people may confuse the feelings of balance, truth, and beauty channeled through electronic music, as being cold, distant, or empty. This is because its power is so stark and profound, that it goes beyond what many people can grasp. Ã¢â‚¬Å“DelaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is incredibly hypnotic and suggestive. If you close your eyes, the music takes you through many different dimensions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ frozen waters, dark caverns and clear blue skies, green mountaintops.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb85ef5afd53fe12e62221b53c596e5b7ec1cd24","amp;dn":"Dakota+-+Delave+-+%5B2014%5D+Free+Mixtape","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb85ef5afd53fe12e62221b53c596e5b7ec1cd24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,133,239,90,253,83,254,18,230,34,33,181,60,89,110,91,126,193,205,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
