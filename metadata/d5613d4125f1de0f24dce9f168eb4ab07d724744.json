Verses. Drawing upon influences like Deftones and Chevelle, their songs continue to evolve and surprise while often unearthing strange sounds. Applying their deep-rooted impressions from hard rock, Versus Vs. Verses uses imagination and composition to tell a story, making every song an attempt at invention and discovery\n\nVersus Vs. Verses is a Hard Rock band from Oshawa, Ontario CANADA\nTheir sound can be described as Chevelle meets Deftones with a twinge of TOOL thrown in for good measure.\n\nVvV was conceived in December 2014 by Mark Beitle and Brian Hatcher featuring members from the now defunct band District Down. They released their 6 song debut EP &quot;We're Not Who We Wish We Were&quot; Recorded at DIOFS Studios\n\nFeaturing the songs\n\n1. Visions Of Blurry Lines\n2. Cosmonaut\n3. The Dark Water\n4.
