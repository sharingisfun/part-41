Director John Boorman (Deliverance) masterfully handles the tale of the mythical sword Excalibur, and its passing from the wizard Merlin to the future king of England. Arthur pulls the famed sword from a stone and is destined to be crowned king. As the king embarks on a passionate love affair with Guenevere, an illegitimate son, and Merlin's designs on power, threaten Arthur's reign. The film is visually stunning and unflinching in its scenes of combat and black magic. Featuring an impressive supporting cast, including early work from the likes of Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne, Excalibur is an adaptation of the legend both faithful and bold.\n\n  Starring: Nigel Terry, Helen Mirren, Nicholas Clay, Cherie Lunghi, Paul Geoffrey, Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson.\n\n  Directed by: John Boorman.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 21min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e57ca97f1b641e7882c74b2a1c768af730877625","amp;dn":"Excalibur+%281981%29+%28Nigel+Terry%2C+Helen+Mirren%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e57ca97f1b641e7882c74b2a1c768af730877625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,124,169,127,27,100,30,120,130,199,75,42,28,118,138,247,48,135,118,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
