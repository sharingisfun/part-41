Some past cultures even worshipped dolphins and condemned anyone who killed or wounded of them. Yet in recent decades, a paradox: on the one hand, we have discovered extraordinary depths of dolphin intelligence and their emotional lives, to the point of glimpsing their self-consciousnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½on the other hand, in Japan, dolphins are slaughtered indiscriminately, and several nations keep them in cruel conditions.\n\nAbout the Author\nDiana Reiss is one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading experts on dolphin intelligence who has helped lead the revolution in dolphin understanding for three decades. In addition, as an activist, she is a leading rescuer who helped inspire and served as an adviser for The Cove, and who continues to campaign against the annual Japanese slaughters. Here, she combines her science and activism to show us just how smart dolphins really are, and why we must stop mistreating them. Readers will be astonished at dolphinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sonar capabilities  at their sophisticated, lifelong playfulness  at their emotional intelligence  and at their ability to bond with other species, including humans and even dogs! Her beloved companion dolphins, each with distinct personalities, create their own toys, type commands on a keyboard, tease and scold her playfully, and express their affection and delight. In ReissÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most famous experiments, she used a mirror to prove that dolphins are self-aware, and even self-conscious. The Dolphin in the Mirror is both a scientific revelation and a emotional eye-opener, revealing one of the greatest intelligences on Earth.\n\nCONTENTS\nPrologue\n1. Minds in the Water\n2.
