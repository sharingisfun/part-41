For seventeen-year-old Connie, however, the newcomers provide a tantalising glimpse of the wider world Ã¢â‚¬â€ a world beyond the gossip and petty concerns traded over the counter of CleatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Corner Store. \n\nAs the Onorati brothers begin to cast an unexpected influence over Leyton, Connie realises that, like them, she must grapple with her ambitions and dreams for the future. But what can any of them hope to find in the ruins of all theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lost?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d66fd08f36fcdd8c870378e2f10dbd905ab0b509","amp;dn":"The+Italians+at+Cleat%27s+Corner+Store+by+Jo+Riccioni+%28retail+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d66fd08f36fcdd8c870378e2f10dbd905ab0b509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,111,208,143,54,252,221,140,135,3,120,226,241,13,189,144,90,176,181,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
