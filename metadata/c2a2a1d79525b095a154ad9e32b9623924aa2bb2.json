ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see why, since its most easy pleasures derive from a cool juxtaposition and stylisation of sound and imagery. But thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more to it: the film also functions as a knowing, lightly feminist homage to Hitchcock and the chief exponents of the Giallo genre, Dario Argento and Mario Bava. As such, its ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“meaningsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ may not be instantly traceable through a cosy linear storyline or densely wrought characterisations.\n\nIn immaculate detail and with barely any dialogue, the film depicts three symbolic events in the life of Ana: the first involves a family death and some mid-coitus voyeurism; another shows her first experience of male attraction; and the final, most impressive chapter (a wholesale updating of a key segment from ArgentoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Deep RedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) sees our heroine (played by Marie Bos, pictured above) sneaking around an eerie, European mansion, maybe stalked by a razor-wielding maniac.\n\nCattet and Forzani sculpt with pure mood. They deliver a vivid sense of AnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heightened sensitivity towards her surroundings via an array of bravura camera tricks and fine edits. The best way to describe it would be to imagine the shower scene in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PsychoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ played over feature length. A large part is shot in extreme close-up, mostly of AnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes or the silhouette of her crotch underneath a billowy cotton summer dress. \n\nThis technique imbues the film with a rich sense of texture, such as in an early scene where Ana runs her fingers over the cracking, mottled skin of (what appears to be) the corpse of an old man, or later when sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s riding in a taxi and the heat makes the leather trim too hot to touch. Some may find the film a mite academic in its glassy deconstruction of genre convention, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perhaps asking a bit much to read it as anything more than a claustrophobic portrait of sexual danger, but it still fulfils that highly specific brief with blood-splashed gusto.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2a2a1d79525b095a154ad9e32b9623924aa2bb2","amp;dn":"+French+Film+Collection%28Film+101%29+Amer+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2a2a1d79525b095a154ad9e32b9623924aa2bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,162,161,215,149,37,176,149,161,84,173,158,50,185,98,57,36,170,43,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
