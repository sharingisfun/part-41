That was the thinking when a young deep-voiced singer named Johnny Seay was renamed and encouraged to sing like a slightly older deep-voiced singer named Johnny Cash. Johnny Sea recorded quite prolifically for ten years between 1958 and 1969, but we've focused on his studio recordings for NRC and Philips when producers Bill Lowery and Shelby Singleton encouraged him to record in the Johnny Cash style. In fact, Johnny C. was enough of a fan of Johnny Sea to offer him a song, My Old Faded Rose, and Johnny Sea got into the charts with Johnny C.'s adaptation of Frankie's Man Johnny, as well as a song closely associated with Waylon Jennings and Bob Luman, My Baby Walks All Over Me. These recordings were no mere act of copyism. Johnny Sea put his unique spin on the Johnny Cash style, and all Cash fans will enjoy hearing this unique collection of '50s and '60s recordings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46a0308e39997b91f9b183ac223111ed17f6cf0","amp;dn":"Johnny+Seay+-+Blue+Moon+Of+Kentucky+%5B1958-1964%5D%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46a0308e39997b91f9b183ac223111ed17f6cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,106,3,8,227,153,151,185,31,155,24,58,194,35,17,30,209,127,108,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
