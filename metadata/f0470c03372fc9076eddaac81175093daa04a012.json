Celebrating their 30th anniversary, Simply Red play a couple of tunes from their first new album in eight years, Big Love, plus one of their classics and from north London comes rapper and grime artist Skepta with his breakout tune Shutdown. Currently on what is billed as her last tour of the UK, legendary singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading is also in the room with a song or two from her catalogue. From Fort Worth, Texas, comes Leon Bridges, who is steeped in the look of the 1950s drive-in with a voice in the style of Sam Cooke and performs a couple of tracks from his upcoming Coming Home LP. Also in the studio, from Illinois, is Ezra Furman, who with his group performs a couple of numbers in the style of 'the rebellion of 90s indie rock, a string of sunshine-y 80s pop, and the snarl of 70s punk'.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 1.88 GB\nRun-Time__: 30 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps 7998Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 CBR 2ch 48KHz 192Kbps\nAudio#2___: MP2 CBR 2ch 48KHz 256Kbps\nSubtitle#1: Teletext\nSubtitle#2: DVB Subtitle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0470c03372fc9076eddaac81175093daa04a012","amp;dn":"BBC.Later.with.Jools.Holland.S46E06.Live.1080i.h264-NX.ts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0470c03372fc9076eddaac81175093daa04a012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,71,12,3,55,47,201,7,110,221,170,200,17,117,9,61,170,4,160,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
