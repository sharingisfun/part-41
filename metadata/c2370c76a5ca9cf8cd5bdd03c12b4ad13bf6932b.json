We believe on the ground idealism of the root\nof the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and\nnothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do\nthis for the competition and the heart of what got the scene\nstarted in the mid eighties.\n\nIf you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back\non contacting us as soon as possible.\ntwice the fun  / double the trouble\n\nOn with the game release information:\n\nA tale of murder and deception with nothing less than the fate\nof humanity at stake, DARKSTAR is a race against the clock in\na quest to turn back time itself.\n\nExperienced through exploration &amp; discovery, your journey\nbegins on a wrecked starship light years from earth-a world\nthat centuries ago has been annihilated. You are Captain John\nO'Neil (Clive Robertson) stranded on the starship Westwick\nwith no memory of what has transpired, or even of who you are.\nNothing is as it seems, and despite the icy, cold silence...\nyou are not alone.\n\nDARKSTAR provides hours of entertainment in both interactive\nadventure and cinema, and features the entire original cast of\nMystery Science Theater 3000 and music by Progressive Sound\nand MetalWorx. This is also the final performance of the late,\ngreat Peter Graves. With more footage than any &quot;game&quot; ever\nproduced (over 13 hours), DARKSTAR is a true interactive\nanimated world with live-action actors.\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1. Unpack release\n2.
