One morning, a young lady awakens to find that she has lost all her memories prior to that morning. Her life, her relationships, her very nameÃ¢â‚¬â€all gone. All that's left is a cell phone with numbers and names she doesn't recognize and Orion, a young boy that only she appears to be able to see. With Orion's guidance, she struggles to make sense of herself, a boyfriend she doesn't know and the thousand and one little things that make up a daily life. But with no memories left, the only alternative is to forge new ones, even if that means leaving old loves behind.\n\nType: TV\nEpisodes: 12\nStatus: Finished Airing\nAired: Jan 7, 2013 to Mar 25, 2013\nProducers: Brains Base, Sentai FilmworksL\nGenres: Fantasy, Romance, Shoujo\nDuration: 23 min. per episode\nRating: PG-13 - Teens 13 or older\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80148bc3c91e4608ac1facf0417dc911cbbeb043","amp;dn":"Amnesia+Ep+10+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80148bc3c91e4608ac1facf0417dc911cbbeb043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,20,139,195,201,30,70,8,172,31,172,240,65,125,201,17,203,190,176,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
