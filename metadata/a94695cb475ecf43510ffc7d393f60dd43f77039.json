During a journey through a labyrinth his camera serenely glides along the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s canals, down its streets and across its squares. On the way he encounters old and new Amsterdamers, a variety of inhabitants from all four corners of the world, on Ã¢â‚¬Å“a voyage around the world in his own home townÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The hero of AMSTERDAM GLOBAL VILLAGE is Khalid, a young Moroccan moped courier who takes the viewer along as he races around town with his precious cargo of films and photographs. But just as Amsterdam is a global village, the film is also largely global, as Johan van der Keuken follows several trails back to their roots far from the city. He follows the Chechen businessman Borz-Ali back to Grozny at war. He accompanies Roberto back to his native village in Bolivia to see the mother who had given him up for dead. A Jewish woman and her son visit the mansion where she found her son after the war and three years of fearful separation.\n\nThe film is also a musical journey, from DJ 100% Isis and her House music to a Ghanian funeral party to Riccardo Chailly in the Concertgebouw. Johan van der Keuken has pieced together major global issues with very personal tales into a beautiful and colourful patchwork quilt. A loving portrait of the city of Amsterdam which has for centuries been a refuge for so many while maintaining its village charm.
