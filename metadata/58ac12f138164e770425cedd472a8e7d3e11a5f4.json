Bill Evans and his 1965 trio (which also includes bassist Chuck Israels and drummer Larry Bunker) meet a symphony orchestra conducted and arranged by Claus Ogerman. They perform adaptations of six classical themes plus a pair of Evans compositions (&quot;Time Remembered&quot; and &quot;My Bells&quot;) but, as one might expect, the strings weigh down the music and Evans' improvisations are somewhat buried beneath the unimaginative arrangements. This is one of Bill Evans' least significant recordings, a weak third stream effort.\n\n(I don't entirely agree, but this is far from his best work)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ac12f138164e770425cedd472a8e7d3e11a5f4","amp;dn":"Bill+Evans+Trio+-+With+Symphony+Orchestra+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ac12f138164e770425cedd472a8e7d3e11a5f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,172,18,241,56,22,78,119,4,37,206,221,71,42,142,125,62,17,165,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
