By combining Alice Cooper's shock rock with the bluesy, metallic stomp of the New York Dolls and Aerosmith, they helped establish hair metal as a commercial genre, sending their first five albums to platinum status in the process. Such success was at least partially due to MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e's reputation as a riotous pack of rabble-rousers, replete with drug addictions, near-death experiences, groupie encounters, and celebrity girlfriends. Of course, that same self-indulgence nearly derailed the band, forcing the musicians to embrace sobriety during the creation of their most successful album to date, 1989's Dr. Feelgood. Like most hair metal bands, MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e's album sales waned during the 1990s, as the popularity of grunge overshadowed most of the music that immediately prefaced it. Nevertheless, the band soldiered through the decade with modest success, releasing two gold-selling albums along the way. The new millennium brought similar luck, as MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e established themselves as a fashionable touring act (with CrÃƒÂ¼e Fest becoming the summer's highest-grossing festival in 2008) while continuing to release new material. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.95% CDDA &amp; 99.82% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tHip-O Records\nCatalog:\t\tB0003909-02\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01.Live Wire\n02.Piece Of Your Action\n03.Toast Of The Town\n04.Too Fast For Love\n05.Black Widow\n06.Looks That Kill\n07.Too Young To Fall In Love (Remix)\n08.Helter Skelter\n09.Shout At The Devil\n10.Smokin' In The Boys Room\n11.Use It Or Lose It\n12.Girls, Girls, Girls\n13.Wild Side\n14.You're All I Need\n15.All In The Name Of...\n16.Kickstart My Heart\n17.Without You\n18.Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\n19.Same Ol' Situation (S.O.S.)\n20.Dr. Feelgood\n\n\nCD 2\n\n01.Anarchy In The U.K.\n02.Primal Scream\n03.Home Sweet Home ('91 Remix)\n04.Hooligan's Holiday (Brown Nose Edit)\n05.Misunderstood (Successful Format Version)\n06.Planet Boom\n07.Bittersuite\n08.Afraid (Alternative Rave Mix)\n09.Beauty\n10.Generation Swine\n11.Bitter Pill\n12.Enslaved\n13.Hell On High Heels\n14.New Tattoo (Single Version)\n15.If I Die Tomorrow\n16.Sick Love Song\n17.Street Fighting Man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e1e4b3ef92bd465bcd5a782873be9848282267","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-+Red%2C+White+And+Crue+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e1e4b3ef92bd465bcd5a782873be9848282267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,225,228,179,239,146,189,70,91,205,90,120,40,115,190,152,72,40,34,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
