Step out among the stars and experience the truly awesome power of God through this glimpse of His vast creation.\nTake a breathtaking look at the universe that is comprehensive guide to the heavens! Sit back and explore the world at your fingertips in this book which:\n- Explains the scale and size of the universe that is hard for our minds to imagine - yet can only indicate the Master's hand at work.\n- Over 50 full-color, rarely seen photos of stars, nebulas, and galaxies.\n- Filled with facts that challenge secular theories and models of the universe - how it began and how it continues to amaze the scientific community.\n- Explores numerous evidences that point to a young universe: magnetic poles of planets, the spiral shape of galaxies, comets and how long scientists think they can last, and much more.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Lisle graduated summa cum laude from Ohio Wesleyan University where he double-majored in physics and astronomy, and minored in mathematics. He did graduate work at the University of Colorado where he earned a MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics. While there, Dr Lisle used the SOHO spacecraft to investigate motions on the surface of the sun as well as solar magnetism and subsurface weather. His thesis was entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Probing the Dynamics of Solar Supergranulation and its Interaction with Magnetism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Among other things, he discovered a previously unknown polar alignment of supergranules (solar convection cells), and discovered evidence of solar giant cells. He has also authored a number of papers in both secular and creation literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b6f397821b20a28f1f4f9387ddbc0e5434c7870","amp;dn":"Taking+Back+Astronomy+-+Dr.+Jason+Lisle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b6f397821b20a28f1f4f9387ddbc0e5434c7870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,111,57,120,33,178,10,40,241,244,249,56,125,219,192,229,67,76,120,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
