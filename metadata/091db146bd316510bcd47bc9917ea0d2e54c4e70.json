The focus of the series is a new American bloodline of vampires, born in the American West in the late 1800's. The first of this new species is a notorious outlaw named Skinner Sweet, who wakes from death, after being infected, to find he has become a new kind of vampire, something stronger and faster than what came before, impervious to sunlight, with a new set of strengths and weaknesses. The series goes on to track his movements through various decades of American history - along with the movements of his first and only known progeny: Pearl Jones, a young woman working as a struggling actress in the 1920's silent film industry when she is attacked by a coven of European vampires hiding in Hollywood. Sweet saves her (uncharacteristically) by giving her his blood, thereby turning her into an American vampire like him, at which point she seeks revenge on the classic vampires who attacked her in life. The complicated and charged relationship Jones has with Sweet is another focus of the series.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Vampire&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Vampire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vertigo.blog.dccomics.com/tag/american-vampire/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vertigo.blog.dccomics.com/tag/american-vampire/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fangoria.com/index.php?view=article&amp;id=4178:american-vampire-13-comic-review&amp;option=com_content&amp;catid=54:comics-reviews&amp;Itemid=185&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fangoria.com/index.php?view=article&amp;id=4178:american-vampire-13-comic-review&amp;option=com_content&amp;catid=54:comics-reviews&amp;Itemid=185&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nAmerican Vampire 001 - Big Break - Bad Blood.cbz\t25.0 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 002 - Morning Star - Deep Water.cbz\t24.7 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 003 - Rough Cut - Blood Vengeance.cbr\t24.3 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 004 - Double Exposure - One Drop of Blood.cbz\t23.1 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 005 - Curtain Call - If Thy Right Hand Offend Thee, Cut It Off.cbz\t23.0 MB\t\n\nAmerican Vampire 006 - Devil in the Sand - Part 1.cbr\t18.7 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 007 - Devil in the Sand - Part 2.cbr\t18.8 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 008 - Devil in the Sand - Part 3.cbr\t21.8 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 009 - Devil in the Sand - Conclusion.cbr\t19.9 MB\t\n\nAmerican Vampire 010 - The Way Out - Part 1 of 2.cbr\t22.8 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 011 - The Way Out - Part 2 of 2.cbz\t22.9 MB\t\n\nAmerican Vampire 012 - Strange Frontier.cbz\t17.7 MB\t\n\nAmerican Vampire 013 - Ghost War - Part 1.cbz\t18.0 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 014 - Ghost War - Part 2.cbz\t17.6 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 015 - Ghost War - Part 3.cbz\t16.9 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 016 - Ghost War - Part 4.cbz\t17.7 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 017 - Ghost War - Part 5.cbz\t17.1 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 018 - Ghost War - Conclusion.cbz\t18.6 MB\t\n\nAmerican Vampire 019 - The Beast in the Cave - Part 1.cbz\t25.8 MB\t\nAmerican Vampire 020 - The Beast in the Cave - Part 2.cbz\t25.1 MB\t\n\nSurvival of the Fittest\\American Vampire - Survival of The Fittest 01.cbr\t17.2 MB\t\nSurvival of the Fittest\\American Vampire - Survival of The Fittest 02.cbr\t16.5 MB\t\nSurvival of the Fittest\\American Vampire - Survival of The Fittest 03.cbr\t16.2 MB\t\nSurvival of the Fittest\\American Vampire - Survival of The Fittest 04.cbr\t17.1 MB\t\nSurvival of the Fittest\\American Vampire - Survival of The Fittest 05.cbr\t17.2 MB\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:091db146bd316510bcd47bc9917ea0d2e54c4e70","amp;dn":"Vampire+%281-20+%2B+Survival+of+the+Fittest%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"091db146bd316510bcd47bc9917ea0d2e54c4e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,29,177,70,189,49,101,16,188,212,123,201,145,126,160,210,229,76,78,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
