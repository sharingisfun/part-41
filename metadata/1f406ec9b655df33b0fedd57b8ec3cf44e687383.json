She is best known for her 1960 hit &quot;I'm Sorry&quot;, and 1958's &quot;Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree&quot;, a US holiday\nstandard for more than 50 years.\nAt 4 ft 9 inches tall, she received the nickname Little Miss Dynamite in 1957 after recording the song &quot;Dynamite&quot;; and was one of the earliest pop stars to have a major contemporary international following.\nLee's popularity faded in the late 1960s as her voice matured, but she continued a successful recording career by returning to her roots as a country singer with a string of hits through the 1970s and 1980s. She is a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music, Rockabilly and Hit Parade Halls of Fame. Lee currently lives in Nashville, Tennessee. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Lee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Lee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTheese are the two cd's individually released as Anthology vol. 1 and Anthology vol. 2.
