It stars actor Robert Wuhl. The show looks at the facts and myths of American history in a comedic view.\n\nThe first part of the series debuted in 2006. In this edition Wuhl &quot;Assumes the Position&quot; that History is Pop Culture. He discusses topics such as the real story behind Paul Revere's Midnight Ride, first sentence of the U.S. Constitution being a &quot;grammatical fuck-up&quot;, and how he believes that &quot;star fucking,&quot; or the phenomenon of the U.S. public becoming infatuated with celebrity figures, and &quot;gay battle cries&quot; are &quot;as American as apple pie.&quot;\n\nAssume the Position 201\n\nIn part two, which debuted in July 2007, Wuhl &quot;Assumes the Position&quot; that History is Based on a True Story. This time he talks about the lack of diversity among the U.S. Presidents, how lousy leaders are as American as apple pie, and his class plays &quot;Real or No Real&quot; determining whether various food icons, such as Chef Boyardee and Aunt Jemima, were real people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e478fc1834803e0bdebfd18cb267bf05f4335067","amp;dn":"Assume+The+Position+-+Robert+Wuhl+HBO+Comedy+Special+1-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e478fc1834803e0bdebfd18cb267bf05f4335067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,120,252,24,52,128,62,11,222,191,209,140,178,103,191,5,244,51,80,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
