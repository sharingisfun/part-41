Babyshambles released their self-titled\ndebut 7&quot; in April 2004, and settled on the lineup of\nDoherty, guitarist Patrick Walden, bassist Drew McConnell,\nand drummer Gemma Clarke by that summer. That fall, things\nwent relatively smoothly for the band, with a sold-out\nU.K. tour and the release of a second single,\nKillamangiro, on the Libertines&amp;#039; former label, Rough\nTrade. But by December, the band had to cancel or halt\nshows because Doherty was unable to perform; one of these\nsudden cancellations sparked a riot at the London Astoria.\nClarke left the band early in 2005 and was replaced with\nnew drummer Adam Ficek.\n\nDespite the band&amp;#039;s ongoing tumult -- which included\nDoherty&amp;#039;s arrest for allegedly assaulting and blackmailing\ndocumentarian Max Carlish (these charges were dropped that\nspring) -- Babyshambles began work on their first album.\nTeaming up with former Libertines producer Mick Jones, the\nband worked on the album through the spring and summer of\n2005 and released the single Fuck Forever that August as a\nteaser for the full-length. Down in Albion was released in\nthe U.K. that fall and Babyshambles toured in support of\nit, although the band canceled almost as many gigs as it\nactually performed. Doherty&amp;#039;s wild behavior continued and\nhis numerous run-ins with the law, which included being\nheld on suspicion of stealing a car and possession of\nclass A drugs in early 2006 and being arrested three times\nin one day, made Babyshambles&amp;#039; existence as perilous as\never. Down in Albion was released in the U.S. that spring.\nThe Blinding EP arrived in fall 2006. Shotter&amp;#039;s Nation,\nBabyshambles&amp;#039; first full-length for EMI/Parlophone,\narrived the following fall, boasting more polished\nproduction and focused songwriting.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef8f1cbb30775c476a513b514a0c2f273937f247","amp;dn":"Babyshambles-Live_De_La_Semaine-DVBS-2007-JUST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef8f1cbb30775c476a513b514a0c2f273937f247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,143,28,187,48,119,92,71,106,81,59,81,74,12,47,39,57,55,242,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
