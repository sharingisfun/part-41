I still seeding these torrents alone.\nAnd since my laptop has limited space and there's much more torrenting to do I though let's give those torrent a swing by collecting them and seed them as one torrent.\nFurther: Much was quite scattered around Demonoid and to get some release I also had to download releases already found somewhere else here, which I always did cause of lack of seeders, partially download might've killed the torrent.\nSo, to finally seed all this material properly and to make it easier for the rest I made this collection. Enjoy ;-)\nAnd how come that all this are mp3's and not FLACS like the 1st Shawn Smith Collection? This is how I found them. Always looked for the highest mp3 quality though.\n\nBRAD\nBest Friends?
