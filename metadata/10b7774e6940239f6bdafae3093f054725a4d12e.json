Balrum features a living fantasy world with deep tactical combat and dozens of side quests next to an epic main quest. In addition to traditional RPG features Balrum has deep crafting which allows the player to craft their own custom items. Balrum also features farming your own crops, building your home, and survival mechanics complemented by the game's main features. In Balrum you control a single character, but your character will have a faithful animal companion as a pet. Your pet is fully controllable and adds greatly to the complexity of the combat. \r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nSuggested by the community: \r\n-Pet swap (when out of combat you now swap places when walking to the tile where your pet currently is) \r\n-Now we allow special characters when you create your map notes. \r\n-Repairable equipped items appear on the top of the list in the repair panel. (with a different color) \r\n-At your safeplace berry bushes now regrow. (only at your safeplace) \r\n-Now there is a â€œdual classâ€ warning panel when you dual class. \r\n-Class skill tooltips now tell you about dual classing. \r\n-When dual classed, teachers now tell you why they cannot teach you. \r\n-You are now able to easily swap rings. \r\n-While walking and simultaneously pressing 'M' the map panel won't immediately open the new note panel (if the cursor is inside the map panel). \r\n-You are now able to rename your pet in the pet panel. \r\n-You are now able to pick up multiple items from a stack when pressing the middle mouse button instead of one item. \r\n-Major health/mana potion recipes are now learnable from teachers. \r\n-Your pet is a little less twitchy. \r\n-When you die the menu is now in a different place so involuntary clicks won't be a bother from now on. \r\n-Tab switches now pulsate so they are easier to notice. \r\n-Pet AI commands in the pet menu now have a tooltip with explanation. \r\n-To lower the involuntary chopping of trees and mining during combat there is a text next to the cursor telling you your click will either chop down a tree or start mining. \r\n-When defeating a certain boss the teleporter that teleports you outside now has an effect so you can notice it easier. \r\n-When trying to open your map in the desert a floating text now tells you that there is no map for the desert. \r\n-The fullscreen button in the options panel now informs you that you should check the automatically selected fullscreen resolution for correctness (multiple monitors with different resolutions). \r\n\r\nFixes: \r\n-You can no longer auto-walk right after combat if a spider web is on you. \r\n-There is no false warning (in the debug.txt) when repeatedly pressing ESC while walking. \r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nOpen 'Balrum v1.08.exe' , wait for a bit for the self extractor to open, specify the directory where u want to extract the game folder, open the extracted folder and play.....\r\nOR\r\nExtarct it yourself using 'WinRAR'\r\n\r\nAlways open the game using run as administrator\r\n\r\nCheck my FB page for more :\r\nMr DJ repacks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10b7774e6940239f6bdafae3093f054725a4d12e","amp;dn":"Balrum+version+1.08+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10b7774e6940239f6bdafae3093f054725a4d12e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,183,119,78,105,64,35,159,107,218,250,227,9,63,5,71,37,164,209,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
