I took all the PDF&amp;#039;s, converted them to JPG&amp;#039;s and packed them into CBZ&amp;#039;s so they could be read by the various comic viewers out there (CDDisplay, ComicRack, etc.) I also broke it up by the decades so it would be easier to download than the original 5 gig download.\n\nAll credit for this goes to the original uploader and/or scanner. I just did the conversion from PDF to JPG and packed them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:751dcc4c9912503d6e1fffe762d9b822eda2fc7f","amp;dn":"A+Decade+of+the+X-Men+-+The+70%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"751dcc4c9912503d6e1fffe762d9b822eda2fc7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,29,204,76,153,18,80,61,110,31,255,231,98,217,184,34,237,162,252,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
