Little do they know, this is an individual game, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be answering to no one but themselves in the most unpredictable Challenge ever.\n\nThe 25th season, Free Agents, forces players to compete on their own in a battle of perseverance and luck. The players will have no idea if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be competing in teams, pairs or as individuals until moments before each challenge begins. Winners are not only safe from elimination, but also have the power to choose one guy and one girl to send in. The losers from that dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenge must take part in the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest elimination twist yet, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The DrawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, where one guy and one girl are selected by pure chance to face the two nominated players in the elimination round. With competitorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fates being determined by a flip of a card, no amount of strategy can protect them.\n\nA grand total of $350,000 is up for grabs, and with so much money on the line, these already blood-thirsty competitors turn vicious. Heated rivalries will take shape, bitter enemies will clash, and heart-tugging relationships will form. Only the lucky few will face the epic final challenge that starts in dangerous rapids and ends at the top of an active volcano. In the end, this season will find the most worthy challenger yet, the ultimate FREE AGENT.\n\nCamila\nCamila starts a rumor about a hook-up in the house.\n\nDo's and Don'ts of Surviving The Challenge\nThe cast gives advice on how to survive The Challenge.\n\n\nThe Challenge: Free Agents premieres Thursday, April 10 at 10/9c.
