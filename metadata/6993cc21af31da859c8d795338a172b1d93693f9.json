Johnny Rotten and Ian Dury both sought release from a social system designed to keep working class oiks like them in their place, and although one approached the task through head-on confrontation and the other with art school nuance, the message was the same: Think For Yourself.\r\n\r\nAfter hundreds of pub gigs as Kilburn &amp; The High Roads, Dury went solo in 1975, writing New Boots and Panties!! over the following year with young and precocious multi-instrumentalist jazzer Chaz Jankel, recording it on the fly with session rhythm section Norman Watt-Roy (bass) and Charley Charles (drums), soon to be the core of The Blockheads. With major record companies running scared of the graphic lyrical content, independent label Stiff licensed it and stepped into a storm around Duryâ€™s misunderstood signature single Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll, which duly had him banned from BBC radio. Absent from the albumâ€™s earliest pressings, Sex &amp; Drugsâ€¦ was misconstrued as a celebration of debauchery and hedonism when it was actually a call for people to question their daily grind.\r\n\r\nIt was far from a lone jewel. Sweet Gene Vincent is a blast of rockabilly hero worship for a kindred spirit, felt by Dury not least because of their common disability â€“ Duryâ€™s leg wasted through childhood polio, the Virginia Whispererâ€™s through a drunken motorbike crash. Lustful opener Wake Up and Make Love With Me sets out Watt-Roy and Charlesâ€™s stall as the pub rock JBs; the squalid Billericay Dickie shows that TOWIE has no new light to shed on Essex ways; Clever Trevor and Plaistow Patricia (with its child-unfriendly opening gambit of &quot;A***holes, bastards, f***ing c***s and p****s&quot;) were down-at-heel characters straight out of an imagined modern Dickens novel.\r\n\r\nDuryâ€™s work quickly mellowed (well, relatively), but the combination of cheeky ire, libertarianism and jazzed-up music hall punk on New Bootsâ€¦ was defiant, original and, 35 years later, stands as a mighty missing link between The Kinks and Blur.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01 - Wake Up And Make Love With Me\r\n02 - Sweet Gene Vincent\r\n03 - I'm Partial To Your Abracadabra\r\n04 - My Old Man\r\n05 - Billericay Dickie\r\n06 - Clever Trevor\r\n07 - If I Was With A Woman\r\n08 - Blockheads\r\n09 - Plaistow Patricia\r\n10 - Blackmail Man\r\n11 - Sex And Drugs And Rock 'n' Roll\r\n12 - Razzle In My Pocket\r\n13 - You're More Than Fair\r\n14 - England's Glory\r\n\r\nCD2\r\n01 - Wake Up And Make Love With Me (Demo)\r\n02 - Sink My Boats (Demo)\r\n03 - Apples (Demo)\r\n04 - England's Glory (Demo)\r\n05 - Tell The Children (Demo)\r\n06 - I Made Mary Cry (Demo)\r\n07 - Sweet Gene Vincent (Backing Track)\r\n08 - Blackmail Man (Demo)\r\n09 - My Old Man (Demo)\r\n10 - Something's Going To Happen In The Winter (Demo)\r\n11 - Wifey (Demo)\r\n12 - Sink My Boats (Alternate Version)\r\n13 - I'm Partial To Your Abracadabra (Demo)\r\n14 - If I Was With A Woman (Demo)\r\n15 - Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll (Demo)\r\n16 - Clevor Trever (Demo)\r\n17 - Blockheads (Demo)\r\n\r\nÂ© 2004 Edsel / Demon Records / Templemill Music / Stiff | MEDCD 751\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nIan Dury - Vocals\r\nChaz Jankel - Guitars, Keyboards\r\nNorman Watt-Roy - Bass\r\nCharley Charles - Drums\r\n\r\nAdditional Personnel\r\nDavey Payne - Saxophones\r\nEdward Speight - Ballad guitar\r\nGeoff Castle - Moog Synthesiser\r\nChris Gabrin - Photos\r\nBarney Bubbles - Brush lettering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6993cc21af31da859c8d795338a172b1d93693f9","amp;dn":"Ian+Dury+%26amp%3B+The+Blockheads+-+New+Boots+And+Panties+%281977%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6993cc21af31da859c8d795338a172b1d93693f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,147,204,33,175,49,218,133,156,141,121,83,56,161,114,177,217,54,147,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
