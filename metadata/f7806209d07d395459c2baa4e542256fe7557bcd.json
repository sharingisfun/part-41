Long Way To Go  \n\nPretty Maids is a heavy metal/AOR band formed in Horsens, Denmark, by Ronnie Atkins and Ken Hammer in 1981. Their sound can be defined as something between Europe and Running Wild. Over the years Pretty Maids have sold hundreds of thousands of records, but have never broken through in a major way, except locally in Japan during the 90s.\n\nThey have supported such well known acts as Black Sabbath, Whitesnake, Deep Purple,\nAlice Cooper, Saxon, and were also featured at the 1987 German version of Monsters of Rock where Metallica headlined along with Deep Purple.\n\nThe band really hit their stride with 1987's Future World which was recorded in New York with renowned producer Eddie Kramer. This was the album that saw the band define their sound, with typically aggressive rockers alongside more commercial, melodic moments.\n\nThe title track &quot;Future World&quot; is really a kick ass song. \nCrank up ur volume to the max and enjoy!\n\nIncluding scans, log, cue\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7806209d07d395459c2baa4e542256fe7557bcd","amp;dn":"Pretty+Maids+-+Future+World+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7806209d07d395459c2baa4e542256fe7557bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,128,98,9,208,125,57,84,89,194,186,164,229,66,37,111,231,85,123,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
