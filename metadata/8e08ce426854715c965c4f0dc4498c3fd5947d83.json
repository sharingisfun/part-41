Bruno and other operatives, including the beautiful and frosty Lili Anders (Sybil Danning) report to Matucci as he coordinates their work. Most of the drama (not all) takes place off-screen, and Matucci essentially narrates the story -- making this one of the least exciting spy dramas around -- even the affair between Matucci and Anders is several degrees cooler than the norm. The inertia of the film continues through to the end, as the final denouement has all the suspects herded into one room (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Agatha Christie or Dashiell Hammett) while Matucci and Manzini discuss the case. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083024/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083024/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nPeter Zinner\n\n\n\n\tFranco Nero\t ... \tCarabinieri Colonel Dante Matucci\n\n\tAnthony Quinn\t... \tBruno Manzini\n\tMartin Balsam\t... \tCaptain Steffanelli\n\n\tSybil Danning\t... \tLili Anders\n\n\tChristopher Lee\t... \tPrince Baldasar, the Director of               \n\n        Counterintelligence\n\n\n\n \n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e08ce426854715c965c4f0dc4498c3fd5947d83","amp;dn":"The+Salamander+%281981%29+Franco+Nero+Anthony+Quinn+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e08ce426854715c965c4f0dc4498c3fd5947d83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,8,206,66,104,84,113,92,150,92,79,13,196,73,140,63,213,148,125,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
