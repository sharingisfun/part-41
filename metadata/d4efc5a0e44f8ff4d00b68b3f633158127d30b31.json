Greatest Hits is a more than generous stack,   \n          bringing together not only the obvious megahits (&quot;I'm a Believer,&quot; &quot;Pleasant Valley  \n          Sunday,&quot; the incredibly propulsive &quot;Valleri&quot;) but also a number of tunes that had the\n          bad luck to fall on the wrong side of the act's swift rise and fall. Foremost among  \n          these is &quot;Porpoise Song,&quot; a lyrically incomprehensible Goffin/King stab at           \n          psychedelia that's at once a crass cashin and one of the loveliest, most fragile    \n          sounds to emerge from the American hippie dream.                                     \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
