Initially making her breakthrough via a guest spot on Chase &amp; Status`s most recent album, she then went on to record a solid #17 chart position with her debut solo effort Go.\n\nDelilah has been tipped for big things in 2012 with a lot of the hype riding on the quality of her forthcoming debut album From The Roots Up, but she has still found time to put together a mixtape called 2-4AM which should get people talking again after she ruled herself out of inclusion in the BBC Sound of 2012 list.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Never Be Another (03:05), 8.58 MB\n02. Love You So (Joe Goddard's Dub You So Mix) (03:08), 8.68 MB\n03. The Gospel (02:43), 7.74 MB\n04. Closer (02:32), 7.33 MB\n05. Love Drug (03:36), 9.76 MB\n06.
