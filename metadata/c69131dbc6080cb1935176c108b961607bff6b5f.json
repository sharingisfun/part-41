It focuses mainly on the development of double and complex remedies which were highly controversial even at the times of Hahnemann, who also experimented with double remedies. Various orientations of homoeopathy, spagyric, naturopathy and conventional medicine advocated homoeopathic remedies and supported medical concepts that were based on Ã¢â‚¬ËœholisticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ views. One of the proponents of alternative healing methods was the renowned Berlin surgeon August Bier (1861-1949).
