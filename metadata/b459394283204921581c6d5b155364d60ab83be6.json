It also features new chapters on spectroscopy in nano-dimensions, nano-optics, and polymer analysis.\nClearly structured into sixteen sections, it covers everything from spectroscopy in nanodimensions to medicinal applications, spanning a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum and the physical processes involved, from nuclear phenomena to molecular rotation processes.\nIn addition, data tables provide a comparison of different methods in a standardized form, allowing readers to save valuable time in the decision process by avoiding wrong turns, and also help in selecting the instrumentation and performing the experiments. \nThese four volumes are a must-have companion for daily use in every lab","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b459394283204921581c6d5b155364d60ab83be6","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Spectroscopy+2nd+ed+%284+Volume+Set%29%28Wiley-VCH%2C+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b459394283204921581c6d5b155364d60ab83be6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,89,57,66,131,32,73,33,88,28,109,91,21,83,100,214,10,184,59,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
