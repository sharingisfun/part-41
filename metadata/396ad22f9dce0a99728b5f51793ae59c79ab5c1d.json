Now they will ramp up properly and eventually, probably, kill you. But hey, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the drama!\n\nSorry about that. Testing storytellers properly is hard because it takes so long and the results are so noisy.\nYour savegames from Alpha 4 will still work.\n\n\nRemember to support the creator of the game if you enjoyed it!\nrimworldgame.com\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:396ad22f9dce0a99728b5f51793ae59c79ab5c1d","amp;dn":"RimWorldAlpha4c+Mac+OS+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"396ad22f9dce0a99728b5f51793ae59c79ab5c1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,106,210,47,157,206,10,153,114,139,95,81,121,58,229,156,121,171,92,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
