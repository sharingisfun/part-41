In a production run lasting from November 1959 to April 1962, the EMD GP20 came to symbolize both the beginnings of the â€œsecond generationâ€ of North American dieselization and the â€œhorsepower raceâ€ of the early 1960s. \r\n\r\nThe GP20 was the first of EMDâ€™s long line of successful â€œGeepsâ€ to be turbocharged, providing the locomotive with 2,000 horsepower. A total of 260 GP20s were constructed for seven U. S. railroads â€“ and the first buyer of the landmark locomotive was the Western Pacific. \r\n\r\nWestern Pacificâ€™s GP20s were built with high noses (a design that had been the norm in the 1950s but would soon be replaced by a short front hood offering enhanced visibility). The units were equipped with dual controls for ease of bi-directional use, weighed 257,000 pounds, and were dressed in Western Pacificâ€™s attractive and iconic â€œZephyrâ€ silver and orange livery. \r\n\r\nWP utilized its GP20s system-wide use, frequently calling upon the versatile diesels to tote heavy or priority tonnage through the rugged Feather River Canyon. Most of Western Pacificâ€™s GP20s remained in service until WP was merged into Union Pacific in 1982, and in 1985 Union Pacific donated Western Pacific 2001 â€“ the first GP20 built â€“ to the Feather River Rail Society and the diesel is today preserved at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum in Portola, California. \r\n\r\nDeveloped by Reppo, the Western Pacific GP20 for Train Simulator features a range of advanced operating features, including authentic start-up procedures and highly realistic operating controls, and a detailed cab interior with dual, bi-directional engineer control stands. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL WORK ON LEGIT AND PIRATED VERSION OF TRAIN SIMULATOR 2016!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4124db50db74b51d83fbd4cde5ad2f734e91b1f","amp;dn":"+Railworks+TS2016+DTG+Western+Pacific+GP20+High+Nose+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4124db50db74b51d83fbd4cde5ad2f734e91b1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,18,77,181,13,183,75,81,216,63,189,76,222,90,210,247,52,233,27,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
