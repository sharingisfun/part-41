ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a lot to do here: rivers, improvements to the simulation, swimming, and the ability to use water as a resource.\nBuilding Improvements, Part 1\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The building system has gone through a major upgrade. This is a work-in-progress. Expect bugs and unfinished features.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You can now create multi-story buildings using the slab, grow-walls, and grow-roof tools! This is especially buggy at this stage of the Alpha, but feel free to try it out.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The road and building designers have been merged into a new GUI.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Hearthlings are smarter about building shapes created out of slabs.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Many more building patterns\nCombat Improvements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Part 2 of the Goblin Campaign: Wolf Raiders! Send your hearthings to free the wolves from their cages before their trainer can turn them on you.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Goblin Camp boss and associated minions are now appropriately armed and buffed.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Wandering undead now spawn at night.\nUI Improvements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Building editor redesign. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now much easier to place and build buildings based on templates.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New menu GUI. Reorganized the menu options to make more sense. Some hotkeys have changed.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In the citizen UI. Clicking a row will not focus the camera on that Hearthling.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In the embark screen, show star ratings for vegetation, wildlife, and minerals.\nPerformance Improvements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ AI: Stonehearth can now handle many more Hearthlings thinking and working at the same time.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Mining large regions and building long roads takes much less CPU time.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Reduced batch-counts for 3D rendering.\nKnown Issues\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Altered requirement equations for new citizens, net worth, food calculations.We have identified a slow memory leak introduced in Alpha 9 which makes Stonehearth use an increasingly large amount of memory the longer you play. This will definitely be fixed before Alpha 10 ships, but is still there as of the current build.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The water simulation is incomplete and is designed to error when running into an unimplemented geometry.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sometimes Hearthlings will build floor or roads before the area has been properly mined out.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Hearthlings sometimes fall through the scaffolding when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modified out from underneath them.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Hearthlings sometimes build a tiny ladder in the hole for the foundation of buildings which never gets destroyed.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Returning trader encounter text does not show time correctly.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Immigration currently limited to 20 Hearthlings. Will raise cap with performance optimizations.\nBug Fixes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Hearthlings used to have difficulty mining out ceilings when already underground. They will now reserve stepping stones to allow them to reach and remove ceiling blocks.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Floating trees are fixed.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Enemy camps no longer spawn astride cliffs.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Altered requirement equations for new citizens, net worth, food calculations.\n\nIf you like the game and can afford to buy it , do so to support the developers !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7476341ccbeb43a945811435d7c725f4317edcb9","amp;dn":"Stonehearth_v0.1.0_dev.2378","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7476341ccbeb43a945811435d7c725f4317edcb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,118,52,28,203,235,67,169,69,129,20,53,215,199,37,244,49,126,220,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
