When the trolley takes more than 5 seconds to arrive, he follows the tracks to the Skipper's house, where he bets him $10 he won't get to work on time. So motivated, the Skipper cuts breakfast short, but he hasn't paid the bill and his power is off. His wife rigs a sail, which gets him going, but a typhoon blows them off course. They land atop Mr. Bang's train. A tunnel knocks the trolley off the train and Mr. Bang into the train but he hasn't paid the $10 bet. The Skipper's wife, Powerful Katrinka, reels in the railroad track to bring the train back, then gets the $10 from Mr. Bang. \n\n\nDirector:\nTom Palmer\nWriter:\nFontaine Fox (comic strip) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0a30fc3af8c42fa0faba7bf37161ab3e2c1ca6e","amp;dn":"TrolleyAhoy+%281936%29%28avi%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0a30fc3af8c42fa0faba7bf37161ab3e2c1ca6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,163,15,195,175,140,66,250,15,171,167,191,55,22,26,179,226,193,202,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
