Each section features dramatically different types of yarns, colors, and stitch patterns combined with timeless, figure flattering silhouettes that are suitable for knitters of all skill levels. Using innovative seamless construction methods, the need for sewing seams has been nearly eliminated by fashioning patterns in one piece from start to finish, easily allowing for adjustments for a custom fit. A handy design workshop features in-depth tutorials that teach seamless construction methods and provide valuable technical information for both beginning and seasoned knitters. Perfect for all body types, the designs are figure flattering with curve friendly waist shaping, empire waist detailing, and stitch details such as lacing, openwork, lace edgings, and bell sleeves that highlight the silhouette.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c63784e8ef3f11918d6e748044adfbb42c59b738","amp;dn":"French+Girl+Knits%2FFrench+Girl+Knits+Accessories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c63784e8ef3f11918d6e748044adfbb42c59b738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,55,132,232,239,63,17,145,141,110,116,128,68,173,251,180,44,89,183,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
