Drawing on rhetorical and narrative theories, the chapters examine thirteen master narratives and explain how extremists use them to solidify their base, recruit new members, and motivate actions. The book concludes with an integration of the idea of master narratives, their story forms, and archetypes into existing strategic communication understandings, and suggestions for using this approach to create counter-terrorism strategies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0836dc9a7004c09e208742a063803b234633c5ef","amp;dn":"Master+Narratives+of+Islamist+Extremism+%282011%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0836dc9a7004c09e208742a063803b234633c5ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,54,220,154,112,4,192,158,32,135,66,160,99,128,59,35,70,51,197,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
