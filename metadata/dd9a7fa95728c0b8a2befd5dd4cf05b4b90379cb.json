It follows a cast of men and women, military and civilian, who serve the nation and cope with a massive responsibility of being so near to the frontline of war. A surprising insight into the very serious nature of some of the work done in the Oxfordshire countryside, the series is set against the background of UK military activity and international emergency disasters. Brize Norton is the beating heart of the Royal Air Force, bigger than most UK airports. It is the country's sole military airbridge for vital supplies and personnel to all British Armed Forces around the world. 250,000 passengers flowed through this military Heathrow in 2011, including troops and freight heading out to combat zones; and even hosting high profile visiting heads of state, politicians, and celebrities. Brize Norton is a small city with its own hotel, fire station, sports clubs, medical centre, postal delivery service, and even a nightclub, but run on military lines, populated by a rich choice of characters whose day-to-day schedules provide a rare and fascinating human insight into military life.\n\n\n1)  Critical Cargo \nBehind the scenes at the biggest and busiest military airbase in the UK, shedding light on the work and lives of its servicemen and women. The series begins with a look at the different critical cargo the compound transports on a daily basis, including a helicopter travelling to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan\n\n2)  Highs and Lows \nTrainee cadets feel the pressure when they undertake the gruelling fast rope course, a skill that is crucial if a helicopter is unable to touch down in hostile territory, and aspiring paratroopers make a daring low-level jump in a bid to earn their wings. Staff members also take part in a mass training exercise to commemorate the Battle of Arnhem, before gathering for a repatriation ceremony\n\n3)  Departure Lounge, Afghanistan \nA soldier returning to the UK is reunited with his family at arrivals, a posting puts a young couple's relationship to the test, and airport security keeps an eye out for any dangerous objects\n\n4)  Prepping for the Frontline \nIn an episode focusing on the role the military air base plays in the preparation for battle, emergency crews step in after a Hercules' landing gear fails. The UK reservists undertake parachute training for Afghanistan, and an American pilot learns how to fly in combat\n\n5)  24/7 \nOfficers from the RAF's own police force set off in pursuit of a drunk driver and their presence is also required to provide security at a repatriation ceremony. Elsewhere, an urgent medical evacuation flight takes off for Afghanistan, and the Officers' Mess commemorates the Battle of Britain\n\n6)  Events \nA look at the public events the military airbase has taken part in, from the world's biggest air show to a team parachute jump on to Blackpool beach. Plus, a view of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee from the cockpit of a Hercules and an insight into the refuelling operation at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony\n\n7)  First Steps \nTraining gets under way for a group of new recruits preparing for a potential deployment in Afghanistan, and the Falcons Parachute Display team makes the first jump of the season. A crash-landing exercise tests the emergency services, and the 216 squadron patrols the skies over the Olympics closing ceremony.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/2276/3kmi.jpg&quot;
