Facing an uncertain future and recently widowed, the signalman takes solace from the past; a past that he increasingly comes to realise was laden with the wrong priorities.\n\nDirector - Yasuo Furuhata\n\nWritten by - Jiro Asada/Yoshiki Iwama\n\nStarring:-\n\nKen Takakura - Otomatsu Sato\nShinobu Ootake - Shizue Sato\nRyoko Hirosue - Yukiko Sato\nHidetaka Yoshioka - Hideo Sugiura\nMasanobu Ando - Toshiyuki Yoshioka\nKen Shimura - Hajime Yoshioka\n\nMy thoughts: A very heartwarming film about a railstation worker who does not know what the future lies ahead as the local station is facing closure for lack of passengers.\nThe younger townspeople are moving from the little town to the bigger cities in order to find work and they leave the older people behind.\nKen Takakura is known for his action/yakuza flicks in the 70/80&amp;#039;s and also he is known in the west for his role in Ridley Scott&amp;#039;s Black Rain as a salary man cop. \nThis must be the first Ken takakura film where he displays his sentimental side, a stunning performance. The remote town in Hokkaido, covered in snow, is beautifully shot. Flashbacks from the past of the railstation worker. A great film that is worth 2 hrs of your time.\nAnother example of Japan is best at making slow paced and heartwarming dramas!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0138c4cfb45827a0b11723c82e93da83337c38eb","amp;dn":"Poppoya+-+Railroad+Man+%28Japan+movie%2C+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0138c4cfb45827a0b11723c82e93da83337c38eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,56,196,207,180,88,39,160,177,23,35,200,46,147,218,131,51,124,56,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
