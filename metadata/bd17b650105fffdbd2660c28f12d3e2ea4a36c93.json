Green Books (16) Mobi\n\n\nSimon R Green\nBest-Selling SciFi &amp; Fantasy\nSimon was born in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, England (where he still resides), in 1955. He has obtained an M.A. in Modern English and American Literature from Leicester University and he also studied history and has a combined Humanities degree. His writing career started in 1973, when he was a student in London. His first actual sale was a story titled Manslayer, back in 1976, but it didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t appear till much later; Awake, AwakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. was his first sale to a professional editor, in 1979. Furthermore he sold some six or seven stories to semi-pro magazines before that market disappeared practically overnight.\n\nAfter years of publishersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ rejection letters, he sold an incredible seven novels in 1988, just two days after he started working at BilboÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bookshop in Bath (this after three and a half years of being unemployed!). This was followed in 1989 by two more, and a commission to write the bestselling novelization of the Kevin Costner film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, which has sold more than 370.000 copies.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd17b650105fffdbd2660c28f12d3e2ea4a36c93","amp;dn":"Simon+R.+Green+Books+%2816%29+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd17b650105fffdbd2660c28f12d3e2ea4a36c93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,23,182,80,16,95,255,219,210,102,12,40,241,45,62,46,164,163,108,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
