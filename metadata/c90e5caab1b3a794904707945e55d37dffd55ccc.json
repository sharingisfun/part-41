O'Hanlon (Wiley,2003).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0471270520\r\n\r\nn the decade and a half since the publication of the Second Edition of A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology there have been many important advances in the field, including spinning rotor gauges, dry mechanical pumps, magnetically levitated turbo pumps, and ultraclean system designs. These, along with improved cleaning and assembly techniques have made contamination-free manufacturing a reality. Designed to bridge the gap in both knowledge and training between designers and end users of vacuum equipment, the Third Edition offers a practical perspective on today's vacuum technology. With a focus on the operation, understanding, and selection of equipment for industrial processes used in semiconductor, optics, packaging, and related coating technologies, A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology, Third Edition provides a detailed treatment of this important field. While emphasizing the fundamentals and touching on significant topics not adequately covered elsewhere, the text avoids topics not relevant to the typical user","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c90e5caab1b3a794904707945e55d37dffd55ccc","amp;dn":"A+User%27s+Guide+to+Vacuum+Technology+3rd+ed+-+John+F.+O%27Hanlon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c90e5caab1b3a794904707945e55d37dffd55ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,14,92,170,177,179,167,148,144,71,7,148,94,85,211,125,255,213,92,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
