The six previously-eliminated contestants return, each to be paired with one the remaining designers. They have to create the garment for the eliminated contestant, and the partner of the winning designer will return to the competition. Helen is teamed with Petrova. While both are skilled designers, Helen is at the end of her tether she&amp;#039;s missing her daughter, and breaks down in tears. This is Petrova&amp;#039;s one chance of rejoining the competition, and her\nfate lies in Helen&amp;#039;s hands. Mark can&amp;#039;t make menswear and he&amp;#039;s relying on Shane to lead the way, while Juli and Deb are a match made in hell, and they can&amp;#039;t agree on a design. Who will be back in, and who will be out?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c223d6565753c4d04bedf717b3d0d32e108955c0","amp;dn":"Project+Runway+Australia+S1E06+XviD-MrHaapy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c223d6565753c4d04bedf717b3d0d32e108955c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,35,214,86,87,83,196,208,75,237,247,23,179,208,211,46,16,137,85,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
