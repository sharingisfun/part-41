Many of the remaining files are choppy in places and may be missing bits, but they are definitely watchable. I tried to fix mistakes in the file names, but there may still be a couple issues.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec30a481dcbc430e9ea15a0100782e54374dba7f","amp;dn":"Forensic+Files+GigaPack+%5BREPACK%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec30a481dcbc430e9ea15a0100782e54374dba7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,48,164,129,220,188,67,14,158,161,90,1,0,120,46,84,55,77,186,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
