Annie Wilkes, Sheldon's number one fan, rescues the author from the scene of a car accident. The former nurse takes care of him in her remote house, but becomes irate when she discovers that the author has killed Misery off in his latest book. Annie keeps Sheldon prisoner while forcing him to write a book that brings Misery back to life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6852b784baa76085151f558c82bed81fcff1f73","amp;dn":"Misery+-+Stephen+King-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6852b784baa76085151f558c82bed81fcff1f73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,133,43,120,75,170,118,8,81,81,245,88,200,43,237,129,252,255,31,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
