Not for renouncing the hoedowns of their early independent releases Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can't holler your love for ever, naturally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but for being capable of touching brilliance without ever sustaining it. Their last album, I and Love and You, contained a heartstopping gem in its title track, whose plain language and unembellished music added up to something greater than its parts. This time, they appear to be making music for montage sequences. The pace is overwhelmingly sombre, the lyrics dwelling on ageing and death and loss Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it mentions winter so much that you might wonder if Michael Fish has been drafted in as lyricist. The Carpenter isn't a total dud, because the Avetts are so skilled with a melody, but the plain-speaking has turned to clunkiness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you'll search hard before finding a more horrible couplet this year than this one from Paul Newman Vs the Demons: &quot;Truth beyond truth and by our design/ It is very fine, like Newman's wine.&quot; But how are his salad dressings, fellas?
