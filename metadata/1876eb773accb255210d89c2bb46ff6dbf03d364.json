You can view and export reports, exclude apps and windows, and group related tasks together into one pool, which is then tracked as a single object. Can be run as a normal application, or a menu-bar-only program.\n\nWhat's New\n\nVersion 1.2:\n\nNew Features\n\n* Wildcarded window titles (i.e. *somewindow*) can now be pooled\n  across all applications. (Hat tip to Visnu P. for the suggestion.)\n\n* Time Sink's CPU usage can be managed via a new slider in the \n  General section of its Preferences.\n\nBug Fixes and Improvements\n\n* License files that end in .xml are now accepted when dropped on Time\n  Sink's Dock icon.\n\n* Time Sink no longer writes occasional spurious messages to the \n  Console.\n\nPre-cracked courtesy of TOBW\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X 10.5 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1876eb773accb255210d89c2bb46ff6dbf03d364","amp;dn":"Time+Sink+v+1.2+%281190%29+pre-%5Bk%5Dcracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1876eb773accb255210d89c2bb46ff6dbf03d364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,118,235,119,58,204,178,85,33,13,137,194,187,70,255,109,191,3,211,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
