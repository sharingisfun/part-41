Instead, he ends up in a motel room with his head in several pieces and a suicide note stuffed in his back pocket.\n\nYears ago, Harry Bosch learned the first rule of the good cop: don't look for the facts, but the glue that holds them together. Now, Harry's making some very dangerous connections, starting with one dead cop and leading to a bloody string of murders that winds from Hollywood Boulevard's drug bazaar to the dusty back alleys south of the border and into the center of a complex and lethal game - one in which Harry is the next and likeliest victim.\n\n--\n\nLength: 11:11:19\nNarrator: Dick Hill","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:887a9a45b34dded907c81a79ad966f73d20bba32","amp;dn":"Michael+Connelly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"887a9a45b34dded907c81a79ad966f73d20bba32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,122,154,69,179,77,222,217,7,200,26,121,173,150,111,115,210,11,186,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
