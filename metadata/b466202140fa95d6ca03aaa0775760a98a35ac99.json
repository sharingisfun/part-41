When I heard the first accords of Slow Summits (2), I immediately thought of a fifty year old song of Soft Machine. When playing it again, it sounded still fresh (the sound a bit less) so I simply had to include it in the list (1) (i like experiencing some musical roots).\n \nAnd because August was a bit diffecult (supply) I had to smoggle a bit and included some older songs that sounded new to me....
