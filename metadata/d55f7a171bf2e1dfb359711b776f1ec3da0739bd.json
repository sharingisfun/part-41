I could walk one block up from Telegraph Avenue, onto Bowditch Street, and just like that, I was in the coolest radio station on the planet, and could request a song. Their vinyl library was massiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œPunk, Reggae, Hip Hop, Soul .. you name it. My early music education came from hanging out there. The first time I heard any great band, I heard it on that station.\nOperation Ivy played live at KALX in 1987. We just had two microphones in the studio Ã¢â‚¬â€ two DJ mics. One to mic the band, and the second mic was used for the vocals. KALX now actually resides on the Cal Berkeley campus. I still love to listen to it whenever in the East Bay.\n \n \nTim Timebomb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar, Vocals\nJesse Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\nKevin Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\nDash Hutton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Background Vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55f7a171bf2e1dfb359711b776f1ec3da0739bd","amp;dn":"Change+That+Song+Mr.+DJ+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55f7a171bf2e1dfb359711b776f1ec3da0739bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,95,122,23,27,242,225,223,179,89,113,27,119,111,30,195,218,7,57,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
