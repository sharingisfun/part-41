This story was originally published in the Transformers (UK) Annual 1992.  Events in this story follow the Marvel Transformers G1 issue #80 and serve as one possible conclusion to the events in that series.\n\nThese scans are taken from a print-out of a pdf of the story and the quality is not as good as a direct scan from the source comic would be.  However, the story is still readable.\n\nEnjoy and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec10430abbac1baac9b400fb5a82fdfe00f8812","amp;dn":"Transformers%3A+Another+Time+and+Place","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec10430abbac1baac9b400fb5a82fdfe00f8812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,193,4,48,171,186,193,186,172,155,64,15,181,168,47,223,224,15,136,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
