The ancient cosmologies and disproved beliefs of the world's major religions are increasingly dissatisfying and irrelevant to growing numbers of people. On the other hand, religion brings many benefits for which the New Atheists have been unable to provide a viable alternative.\n\nThe Triple Path offers a credible synthesis of modern scientific knowledge and the useful teachings and practices of the world's major religions, making use of the latest scientific research and referencing hundreds of peer-reviewed academic papers. The Triple Path is sympathetic to the views of both religious and atheist readers alikeÃ¢â‚¬â€it rejects the disproven dogmas of the religious fundamentalists, but pulls together the scientific research needed to understand which practices and moral teachings of the world's religions are supported by real evidence. \n\nFinally, the Triple Path collects the most moving words of wisdom of the world's great sacred texts and then updates and adds to them to create a new approach relevant to life today.\n\nKey words: Christianity, Atheism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, meditation, prayer, religion, the Bible, Buddha, Dhammapada, Chuang Tzu, Jesus, Gospel of Thomas, Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Tao Te Ching, Jonathan Haidt, elevation\n\nThis book is protected by copyright.
