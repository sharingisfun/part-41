This truth can be summarized as follows: &quot;All events and objects that we encounter in real life-buildings, people, cities, cars, places-in fact, everything we see, hold, touch, smell, taste and hear-come into existence as visions and feelings in our brains&quot;. We are taught to think that these images and feelings are caused by a solid world outside of our brains, where material things exist. However, in reality we never see real existing materials and we never touch real materials. In other words, every material entity which we believe exists in our lives, is, in fact, only a vision which is created in our brains.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79bffb0684f9a8cb3e4acd949c1c3ec6bb663126","amp;dn":"Secret+beyond+matter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79bffb0684f9a8cb3e4acd949c1c3ec6bb663126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,191,251,6,132,249,168,203,62,74,205,148,156,28,62,198,187,102,49,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
