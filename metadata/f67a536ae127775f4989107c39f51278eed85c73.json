Like with all other Photomizer- products, you are able to work smoothly and targeted. The visually appealing interface enables the user to work more intuitive and even more optimal, whereby it is almost a bummer that the 1-click-optimization does most of the work. Furthermore, a zoom function and a full screen-preview are implemented in order to reveal flaws in your photos and allow you to evaluate these.\n\n\nProfiles for effective and fast editing\n\nFurther improvements in order to achieve perfect user-friendliness are the processing profiles. These profiles are complete sets with pre-settings, which were created especially for defined operational areas and take care of the specific needs. The delivery already includes profiles to optimize scanned negatives, scanned slides, webcam pictures and mobile phone snapshots. Complete the time-saving and high-performance collection with self-created profiles for individual viewing habits.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.engelmann.com/en-us/photomizerscan.php?affChecked=1#features&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.engelmann.com/en-us/photomizerscan.php?affChecked=1#features&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\n   Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (32- and 64-Bit)\n   Min. 1 Gigabyte RAM (2 GByte are recommended)\n   CPU with at least 1 GHz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             [Installation]\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRar or other extractor of your choice to extract the rar file\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Install Setup's.\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Just replace &quot;Photomizer Scan 2.exe&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
