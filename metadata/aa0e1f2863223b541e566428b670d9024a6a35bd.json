His latest album, No Better Than This, was released on August 17, 2010 to widespread critical acclaim.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAmerican Fool is the sixth album by John Mellencamp, released under the stage name John Cougar in 1982. This was Mellencamp's last album to be released under the name John Cougar. His next album, Uh-Huh, would be released under the name John Cougar Mellencamp. The album was Mellencamp's commercial breakthrough, reaching number one on the Billboard 200 chart in 1982. According to a 1983 article in the Toledo Blade, the song &quot;Danger List&quot; originated when Mellencamp heard his guitarist Larry Crane playing some chords in a basement rehearsal room. &quot;I turned on the tape recorder and sang 30 verses,&quot; Mellencamp explained. &quot;I just made them up. Then I went and weeded out the ones I didn't like.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0e1f2863223b541e566428b670d9024a6a35bd","amp;dn":"John+Cougar+-+American+Fool+%5B1982%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0e1f2863223b541e566428b670d9024a6a35bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,14,31,40,99,34,59,84,30,86,100,40,182,112,217,2,74,106,53,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
