While Damien's recipes always go to plan, his life never does...\n\n The show is based on the popular Radio 4 sitcom of the same name.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/in_and_out_of_the_kitchen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/in_and_out_of_the_kitchen&lt;/a&gt;\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\n \nIn And Out Of The Kitchen - S01 - E01 - The Diet\nIn And Out Of The Kitchen - S01 - E02 - Valentine's Day \nIn And Out Of The Kitchen - S01 - E03 - The Lodger\n\n\n[/b]\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : In And Out Of The Kitchen.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 26s\nTotal bitrate               : 1 721 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 26s\nBitrate                     : 1 521 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.203\nStream size                 : 309 MB (88%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 26s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 39.1 MB (11%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload          : 504 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 -b 192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1763271a70bad8938cc27bf12ed58ce0e6181acb","amp;dn":"In+And+Out+Of+The+Kitchen+-+S01+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1763271a70bad8938cc27bf12ed58ce0e6181acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,99,39,26,112,186,216,147,140,194,123,241,46,213,140,224,230,24,26,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
