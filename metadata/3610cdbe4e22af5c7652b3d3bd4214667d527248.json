When Two Knotty boys, Dan and JD, began teaching rope bondage together they discovered that people learn best when they are shown close up how to tie knots and combine them with bondage techniques. They replicate this learning process with over 750 photos by acclaimed fetish photographer Ken Marcus and a wealth of captions, delivered in a light-hearted style, offering the world of safe BDSM to a new, curious audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3610cdbe4e22af5c7652b3d3bd4214667d527248","amp;dn":"Two+Knotty+Boys+Back+on+the+Ropes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3610cdbe4e22af5c7652b3d3bd4214667d527248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,16,205,190,78,34,175,92,118,82,179,211,189,66,20,102,125,82,114,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
