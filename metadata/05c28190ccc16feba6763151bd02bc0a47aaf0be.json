The few surviving humans begin researching time travel, in hopes of sending someone back to the pre-war world in search of food, supplies, and hopefully some sort of solution to mankind's imminent demise.\n\nInfo: 'La Jet&amp;eacute;e' is comprised entirely of still shot photography (except one barely noticable scene where you can see the character blink and slightly move). 'La Jet&amp;eacute;e' inspired and influenced Terry Gilliam to make the movie &quot;12 monkeys&quot;.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05c28190ccc16feba6763151bd02bc0a47aaf0be","amp;dn":"La.Jetee.1963.%28French+short+that+inspired+12+Monkeys%29%5BEnglish+Su","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05c28190ccc16feba6763151bd02bc0a47aaf0be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,194,129,144,204,193,111,235,166,118,49,81,189,2,188,10,71,170,240,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
