Using the latest data from Oregon and the Netherlands, he puts a fresh new slant on perennial debate topics such as &quot;slippery slopes,&quot; &quot;the integrity of medicine,&quot; and &quot;sanctity of life.&quot; His engaging writing style brings clarity to these issues. The content is thought-provoking; the arguments are well-researched, air-tight, and original.\n\nThis extraordinary book provides an in-depth look at how we die in America today. It examines the shortcomings of our end-of-life system. You'll learn about terminal torture in hospital ICUs and about the alternatives: hospice and palliative care. With laser-sharp focus, Orfali scrutinizes the good, the bad, and the ugly. He provides an insightful critique of the practice of palliative sedation. The book makes a strong case that assisted dying complements hospice. By providing both, Oregon now has the best palliative-care system in America. Reading this book, above all, may help you or someone you care about navigate this strange landscape we call &quot;end of life.&quot; It can be your gentle and informed guide to &quot;a good death&quot; in the age of hospice and high-tech medical intervention.\n\nRobert Orfali, the guru of client/server systems in the early days of Silicon Valley, co-authored three best-selling books that demystified the complexity of these mission-critical systems and made them understandable to a whole new generation of programmers. The books sold over a million copies. In this book, Robert uses his analytical skills to deconstruct the most complex system he has yet encountered: our modern end-of-life system. He wrote this book after helping his soulmate and coauthor, Jeri, navigate her death from ovarian cancer in 2009. The deep emotions Robert felt allowed him to look at how we die from a different perspective, another angle. Robert also wrote Grieving a Soulmate.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c1ed91635260503f174e4ade547f76148b9e697","amp;dn":"Death+With+Dignity+.Legalizing+Assisted+Dying+.MOBI%2BEPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c1ed91635260503f174e4ade547f76148b9e697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,30,217,22,53,38,5,3,241,116,228,173,229,71,247,97,72,185,230,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
