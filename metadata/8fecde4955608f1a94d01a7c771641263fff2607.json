Surely one of the classiest world-jazz albums of the year. \n\nEVENING STANDARD - UK (writing about Buena Vista Social Club)\n&quot;Roberto Fonseca, the band's young pianist, is a revelation and alone is worth the ticket price&quot;\n\namazon.com --\nFollowing in the long lineage of great Cuban pianists, from Jorge Bolet to Gonzalo Rubalcaba, the brilliant young pianist Roberto Fonseca has been called &quot;the most promising and important talent in Cuban music.&quot; On Zamazu, the former member of the Buena Vista Social Club -- he replaced RubÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©n Gonzalez after his departure -- distinguishes himself as a spectacular player, composer, arranger and bandleader. With bassist Orlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; Lopez, Brazilian percussionist Carlinhos Brown, vocalist Omara Portuondo and Spain's flamenco guitar sensation Vincente Amigo. \n\nFrom his thoughtful, Herbie Hancock-inspired harmonies on &quot;Tierra En Mano&quot; to his driving groove on the churning bata-fueled &quot;Clandestino&quot; to his exotic, Oriental flavored &quot;Congo Arabe,&quot; Fonseca incorporates a wealth of musical influences on Zamazu. There's a touch of American gospel in the passionate title track, an undercurrent of infectious Brazilian groove along with a tinge of American funk on the spirited &quot;Zamazamazu&quot; and an elegant old school feel on the Cuban guajira &quot;Dime Que No.&quot; The darkly alluring and introspective &quot;Llego Cachaito,&quot; a showcase for the great Cuban bassist Orlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; Lopez, is a delicate number that reveals Fonseca's sensitive side while the frantically uptempo interlude &quot;Asi Baila Mi Madfre&quot; is a knuckle-buster that showcases his prodigious keyboard technique. Clarinetist and longtime musical partner Javier Zalba helps conjure up feelings of melancholy and longing on the haunting &quot;Suspiro&quot; and &quot;El Niejo&quot; while Fonseca also turns in a dramatic son montuno reading of Abdullah Ibrahim's &quot;Ishmael,&quot; which is augmented by eight-piece string section. And in one of the most emotionally charged moments on Zamazu, he teams with Buena Vista Social Club singer Omara Portuondo for a poignant reading of &quot;Mil Congojas,&quot; a tune that Fonseca used to play as an intimage duet in concert with the late Ibrahim Ferrer up until the singer's passing in August, 2005.\n\nTracks\n01- Misa Popular\n02- Tierra En Mano\n03- Clandestino\n04- Llego Cachaito\n05- Asi Baila mi Madre\n06- Congo Arabe\n07- Zamazu\n08- Suspiro\n09- Ishmael\n10- El Niejo\n11- Mil congojas\n12- Triste Alegria\n13- Zamazamazu\n14- Dime Que No\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan), EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fecde4955608f1a94d01a7c771641263fff2607","amp;dn":"Roberto+Fonseca+-+Zamazu+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fecde4955608f1a94d01a7c771641263fff2607","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,236,222,73,85,96,143,26,148,208,26,124,119,22,65,38,63,255,38,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
