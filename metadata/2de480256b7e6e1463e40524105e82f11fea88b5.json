Separated from his wife, whom he loves passionately, he is torn between an unrelenting approach to solving serial killings and his attempts to rekindle his marriage. Luther is a highly charged emotional man who is not above stretching the law to solve a case or save a life. In episode one, Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) proves she is equally brilliant by committing the perfect murder of her parents, which challenges Luther as never before. Alice develops a strange fascination for Luther and their continued exchanges and interplay serve as a backdrop for the rest of the season. Luther's edgy police tactics make him a serious concern to his superiors, who feel that he is a threat to their reputations and that of the Police force. From the opening credits to the end of season one, &quot;Luther&quot; is a fast paced mystery presented with many plot twists and insights into the human psyche.   \n\nPLZ SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2de480256b7e6e1463e40524105e82f11fea88b5","amp;dn":"Luther+Season+2+-+dk396","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2de480256b7e6e1463e40524105e82f11fea88b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,228,128,37,107,126,110,20,99,228,5,36,16,94,130,241,31,234,136,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
