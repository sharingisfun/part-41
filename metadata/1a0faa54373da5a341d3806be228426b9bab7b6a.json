Although commonly viewed as a gothic metal band, Type O has also incorporated elements of doom metal and thrash metal. Their dramatic lyrical emphasis on themes of romance, depression, and death resulted in the nickname The Drab Four (in homage to The Beatles Fab Four moniker). The band went Platinum with 1993s Bloody Kisses, and Gold with 1996s October Rust, and gained an enormous following with seven studio albums, two best-of compilations, and concert DVDs.\n\nVideo info: XviD - 344x248 - 29.97fps - 1h 38mn 42s 450ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a0faa54373da5a341d3806be228426b9bab7b6a","amp;dn":"Type+O+Negative+-+Live+In+Detroit+%5B1999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a0faa54373da5a341d3806be228426b9bab7b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,15,170,84,55,61,165,163,65,211,128,107,226,40,66,107,155,171,123,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
