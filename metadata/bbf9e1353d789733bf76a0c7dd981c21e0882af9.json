On the strength of those songs, and\nextensive touring across Canada in 2008, CD pushed their first single\nÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Heavier Than HeavenÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to number 51 on the Canadian rock charts, solidifying\na strong fan base across the country. The year also brought the band a top 5\nwinning slot in the Vancouver Fox 99.3 Seeds competition.\n\nWith recent changes to the band, CD looked to drummer and longtime friend\nJeremy McLachlan from their hometown of Armstrong, B.C. to become their\nfifth and final member. With the core of the band together they now have\ntheir sights set on recording an explosive third record with producer Danny\nCraig from platinum recording artists Default.\n\nCold Driven has shared the stage with: Default, Thornley, The Veer Union,\nState Of Shock, Corb Lund, Danko Jones, and Sam Roberts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbf9e1353d789733bf76a0c7dd981c21e0882af9","amp;dn":"Cold_Driven-The_Wicked_Side_Of_Me-%28EP%29-2011-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbf9e1353d789733bf76a0c7dd981c21e0882af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,249,225,53,61,120,151,51,191,118,160,199,221,152,28,33,224,136,42,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
