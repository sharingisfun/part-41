But with her assets frozen and her husband claiming their house for the Other Woman's Love Child, she needs the job.\n\nZest's gaffes and notoriously bad gaydar endear her to the brides, as well as Bradford, the beautiful male stylist who travels with them. Just when Zest is figuring out how to manage her attraction to the unattainable &quot;safe&quot; man, they arrive in California amidst the worst anti-gay protests San Diego has ever seen.\n\nWhen the minister the women hired turns out to be a Prop 8 zealot hell-bent on preventing the wedding, Zest and the brides are chased across the city in a hilarious yet poignant attempt to foil the protesters and tie the white knot.\n\nGenre: Romance Humor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dfe2cc37696087ecf04041a3314a38b0e955e70","amp;dn":"Heteroflexibility+by+Mary+Beth+Daniels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dfe2cc37696087ecf04041a3314a38b0e955e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,254,44,195,118,150,8,126,207,4,4,26,51,20,163,139,14,149,94,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
