The President then appoints Lawrence Cromwell as secretary for the newly created Department of Amusement. Cromwell creates an army of entertainers and sends them out across the country. Much of the action centers around Cromwell auditioning acts in his office (with interruptions from janitor &quot;George Bernard Shaw&quot; played by Steppin Fetchit). At the end, as a musical production number breaks forth, Cromwell looks out of his office window and sees the Depression literally, instantaneously lift.\n\nUpon release the film was given a strong endorsement by Variety, especially the work of &quot;newcomer&quot; Shirley Temple, whom they cited as the film's &quot;unofficial star.&quot; Although modern scholars often point to the film as an example of typical Great Depression entertainment, Variety expressed reservations about its theme. &quot;This musical is a hodge-podge principally handicapped by a national depression premise. Americans now like to think of themselves in the light of being on the upturn and having rounded that long-awaited corner, so Cheer's plot motivation is basically questionable [and] open to debate.&quot;\n\nThe film had eleven minutes of footage deleted for modern home video release, most of it racial in nature. In 2009, the film was available on both videocassette and DVD in the original black-and-white version and a computer-colorized version of the original. Some versions included theatrical trailers and other special features.\n\nBased on an idea by Will Rogers, the story concerns the efforts by the President of the United States to get the public's mind off the Depression. To this end, he appoints Broadway impresario Lawrence Cromwell (Warner Baxter) to the new cabinet position of &quot;Secretary of Amusement.&quot; Wasting no time, Cromwell sets about to nationalize the entertainment industry, organizing singers, dancers, actors and other variety artists into batallion-like touring units. Cromwell is fought at every turn by a cartel of wealthy industrialists, who've been profiting from the Depression and have no desire to see America pull itself upward. Happily, every effort to bribe or cajole Cromwell into giving up his mission is thwarted and the Department of Amusement goes on to help the the country at a time when its citizens most needed it. Among the highlights are an energetic &quot;revival-meeting&quot; musical number by Aunt Jemima (Theresa Gardella), and 6-year-old Shirley Temple's rendition of &quot;Baby Take a Bow.&quot; Originally released at 80 minutes, Stand Up and Cheer was edited to 69 minutes for reissue, then to 65 minutes (removing most of Stepin Fetchit's scenes) for television: it was this last version which was computer-colorized in 1987.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English, Spanish\nRunTime 80 mins\nSubtitles: Espanol\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 80 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8e9204f469b2d5634a977be31dfb434594d968","amp;dn":"Stand+Up+and+Cheer+%281934%29+DVD5+-+Shirley+Temple+Film+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8e9204f469b2d5634a977be31dfb434594d968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,142,146,4,244,105,178,213,99,74,151,123,227,29,251,67,69,148,217,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
