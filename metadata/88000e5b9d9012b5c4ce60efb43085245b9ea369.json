Friends Of Mine/Three Minstrels \t(CBS 7555) \t1971\n \n\nGraham Field had previously been in Rare Bird. Andrew McCulloch played in King Crimson and Alan Barry had been with the Giles brothers. \n\nReview \nbeestie\nJul 03, 2003\nFields: A short-lived Band with two former members of KING CRIMSON of some sort(Barry,Mc Culloch)(and ex-RARE BIRDie (Graham Field).\nThere is also a connection with:M.Mann's Earthband,ELP ,Gordon Haskell and Arthur Brown.\nThe music can best be described as something between Procol Harem(Not So Good 'title'sic),Emerson,Lake and Palmer(While the Sun Still Shines),Early Renaissance(Three Minstrels)and a lot of:King Crimson of course\nOne radio-hit on it:'A friend of mine'with a 'Mendelssohn-like organ introduction).\n'Feeling Free' and 'A place to lay my head' are  outstanding tracks.\nThis is a very good album....and I forgive them to take so much from previous mentioned bands..... They all were member of them ,they add enough creativity and power ( and don't forget and it's their only album.)\nA very beautiful poster is included (first pressing)\nI own a vinyl version ,as the Japanese CD release is 'very hard to find) \n\nTrack Listing\n-------------\n 1.
