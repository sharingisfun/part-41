I think most people claim that were helpless because they simply don't want to make an attempt to improve the world. They would rather play like children. Or, perhaps a more accurate description of these people is that they would rather titillate their emotions for sex, babies, food, material items, and status.\n\nHowever, we have incredible opportunities. We can design an economy in a variety of ways, and we can create different types of transportation systems, and we can design cities in thousands of different ways. And every product can be improved upon... without exception! \n\n-  Resurrection Of Christopher Bollyn\nNobody has seen any of the Bollyns since they disappeared on June 11, 2007, and now he shows up with Giulietto Chiesa.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.erichufschmid.net/Hufschmid-7Dec2008.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.erichufschmid.net/Hufschmid-7Dec2008.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA partial transcript of the audio\n\n \n\nMy advice is to ignore these truth seekers and their websites and their message boards. They will give terrible attitudes get you depressed. Some of these phony truth seekers are so desperate to attract your attention that they're even more critical of Israel and Jews than my website, but don't fall for that trick. Their criticism of Israel is just the bait they put on their hook to grab your attention.\n\nIt's easy for us to become disillusioned and assume that our situation is hopeless because every nation is still completely dominated by criminals, freaks, alcoholics, and idiots who never have nothing intelligent to say. But if you can maintain a good attitude and continue to encourage people to look at my website and discuss the issues I bring up, then we will eventually be able to find enough peole to do something.\n\nBut in case you don't think we're making progress, let me give you some evidence that we are indeed slowly defeating this crime network.\n\nI started exposing the 9/11 attack in January 2002. The reaction from the public and the criminal Jews was that I was unpatriotic, a Nazi, an anti-Semite, and extreme left-wing liberal, and an extreme right wing patriot. Nobody ever accused me of being a Jew or a Zionist.\n\nHowever, during the past year or so, more and more people are starting to accuse me of being a Jew or a Zionist. In case you don't understand the significance of this, in 2002, many Jews would proudly admit that they were Jewish, and the most extreme insult was to call me a Nazi. Today a lot of the Jews are afraid to admit that they are Jews, and the most extreme insult is to call me a Jew. This is proof that were making progress.\n\nDuring the past six years, millions of people have discovered that 9/11 and other crimes are coming from Jews. This information will continue to spread, and eventally being called a Jew will be the worst insult imaginable. Soon we might see parents scolding their children with remarks such as, &quot;Stop acting like a Jew!&quot;\n\nAt the top of Daryl Smith's site is a warning message that states: &quot;Eric Hufschmid is an Agent Provocateur and handler who comes from a Jewish family and anyone that lends him any support is suspect.&quot;\n\nMichael Collins Piper of the American Free Press, has also accused me of being a Jew, and he's accused Christopher Bollyn's wife of being a Jew.\n\nHow can we not defeat this crime network? These people are so stupid that they don't understand that when they can insult us by calling us a Jew, it's the Jews who are in big trouble, not us.\n\nAs I mentioned in my status report in July 2008, the Jews are losing their reputation as being a loving, peaceful, innocent people. Every day more people are realizing that lots of Jews are horrible, disgusting, psychotic criminals. And these criminal Jews think they're going to get out of this mess by calling me a Jew?! They're idiots!\n\nMore evidence that we're defeating this crime network can be seen with the mysterious website judicial-inc.org. During the past few years, a lot of people have been asking me ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho runs this websiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCan they be trusted?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ I don't know who runs it, but I put a warning on my website to be suspicious of them. But now we can be certain that they are just another operation by criminal Jews. They now have a message board, and it's connected to a website that was originally the New Orleans, Louisiana John Birch Society. In case you don't know much about the John Birch Society, I have some information on my website that shows that they were infiltrated by criminal Jews a long time ago, and they're working with more than just judicial-inc. They also work with Alex Jones and other phony truth seekers.\n\nThe messageboard that judicial-inc is operating has one sentence to explain the rules of conduct. Their rule is:\n\nNo swearing, and we prefer you use the words Bolshevik, Communist, Neo-Con, Zionist, etc, but avoid saying Jew.\njudicial-inc.org/811judicial_forum_nola.htm\n\nWhy would they want us to stop saying the word Jew? If you've seen their website, then you've noticed that they appear to be extremely angry and disgusted with Jews, so why would they want people to stop using the word Jew on their message board?\n\nThe only people who seem to have a problem with the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are the criminal Jews. Nobody else seems to care. It's a proper word in the English language to everybody else, just like the words Catholic, Muslim, Republican, and Canadian.\n\nI think the sensitivity to the word Jew is because the criminal Jews have been hiding in the shadows for years, and they've been fooling us into blaming problems on Communists, Nazis, Muslims, Neo-Cons, corporations, the military-industrial establishment, and Arabs. For decades all of us were foolishly blaming our problems on the wrong group of people. The Jews would laugh as we blamed the Nazis or the corporations.\n\nBut during the past few years the Jews have been hearing more and more people switch from blaming Nazis or Arabs to blaming Jews. The Jews realize that we're talking about them now. They realize that we can see them in the shadows. They're not hiding from us any longer.\n\nThe Jews are becoming frightened, and that explains why they are trying to discourage us from using the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Judicial Inc. wants us to use the words Bolshevik, communist, or neocon. Even ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œZionistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is better to them than the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nWe CAN defeat this crime network. It's true that they have a lot of people in their network, and they may bribing tens of thousands of people in our government, police departments, and military, but it seems as if most of the people in their network are in terrible mental health. It's possible that they outnumber us, but we're not having a fistfight with them, so don't get discouraged. We ARE beating them.\n\nI realize that it's easy to get discouraged. In fact, one of the reasons I haven't posted an audio file for the past two months is because I got discouraged after watching my relatives and more than 100 million other Americans arguing over whether we should elect Obama or McCain as president. It's easy to lose hope for the human race when you realize that you're surrounded by people who are only slightly more advanced than a monkey.\n\nIt can also be discouraging when you see a report about a person who is caught taking bribes. Crime networks can manipulate most people very easily by offering them money. Most people are like a circus animal, but instead of performing tricks for food, they commit crimes for money. It's depressing, but we have to remain cheerful and optimistic.\n\nRemind yourself that there are lots of higher quality humans on this planet, and if we can find enough of them, we can work together to transform this planet into a paradise. The talking monkeys that dominate the planet are not going to help us, but they're not going to stop us either. So, just ignore them.\n\nOnce we find enough high-quality humans, we'll be able to do a lot more than just improve our water heaters, transportation systems, and other products. We also be able to improve our economic system, school system, and government system. We're not helpless.\n\nHowever, improving our social systems requires a major change in attitudes. Most people consider it patriotic to follow the social systems that developed centuries ago, but those people are as foolish as somebody who insists that we use the transportation systems that developed centuries ago.\n\nWe need to find people who realize that it's acceptable to throw an entire government system in the trash and develop something new. The American Constitution is a crude document, and we need to find people who can throw it in the trash. And the Europeans need to discard their monarchies in the trash, as well as their government and economic systems. We need to find people who will let go of this primitive technology and help us develop something better.\n\nWell, I'm getting near the 120 minute mark (note: I should have said 80 minutes, or 1 hour 20 minutes) which is the limit for an audio CD so I'll stop, but now that I've recovered from the depressing election, I'll put up another audio file very soon so that I can finish where I left off because I have a lot more to say.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6013e031d0a1102424fc143f83ccede295fa564","amp;dn":"Eric+Hufschmid+-+Phony+Truth+Seekers+Propaganda+To+Frighten+Us","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6013e031d0a1102424fc143f83ccede295fa564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,1,62,3,29,10,17,2,66,79,193,67,248,60,206,222,41,95,165,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
