The crew make an emergency landing at Detroit, Michigan without any loss of life.\nTwo years later....\nOn 3 March 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 981, another McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, suffers a similar sequence of events during a flight from Paris to London. This time, the DC-10's hydraulic systems are damaged enough that the crew lose control; and the aircraft crashes in a forest near Senlis outside Paris, killing all 346 on board. At the time, it was the worst aviation disaster in history.\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: ................. : AVC\nVideo Bitrate: ................ : 2,165 kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: ....... : 1.78, (16x9)\nVideo Resolution: .......... : 1280x720\nScan type: ...................... : Progressive\nAudio Codec: ................. : AAC LC\nAudio language: ............. : English\nAudio Bitrate: ................. : 160 kbps\nAudio Channels: ............. : 2 (stereo)\nRun-Time: ...................... : 50mn\nFramerate: ..................... : 29.970 fps\nContainer: ...................... : MP4\nPart Size: ........................ : 835 MiB\nSource: ........................... : DVD\nEncoded date: ................ : 2014-07-19\nEncoded by: ................... : Egilman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c70c9dacb3e01bbce572d0b85fae3117292e704e","amp;dn":"Mayday.Air.Crash.Investigations.S05.E02.Behind+Closed+Doors.DVD.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c70c9dacb3e01bbce572d0b85fae3117292e704e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,12,157,172,179,224,27,188,229,114,208,184,95,174,49,23,41,46,112,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
