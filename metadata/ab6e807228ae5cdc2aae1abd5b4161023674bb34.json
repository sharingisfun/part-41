The series follows key members of the London Underground's 19,000-strong staff, from CEO Howard Collins through to the litter pickers who clear miles of track every night. Drivers, station staff and emergency response workers reveal their unique perspective on the travelling public. Capturing the tube in all its guises, from tourist transport to suburban commute, or the last train home for partygoers, this series also looks behind the scenes of the tube's ten billion pound upgrade - and how the process of dragging a Victorian infrastructure kicking and screaming into the 21st century doesn't always run on rails.\n\n\n\n\n4)  Overcrowding \nThe number of passengers on the Tube has gone up by a third in the last ten years. David Waboso, London Underground's head of upgrades, thinks he has the answer. But new trains on the Victoria Line keep letting him down because of a problem with the doors - and a newly-installed signal fails, causing huge delays. At Tottenham Court Road station, supervisor Barry Griffiths is keeping the crowds moving - in the midst of huge rebuilding works making the station six times bigger. But will his customers be impressed with the results?\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/5512/thetubescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/5512/thetubescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/4428/thetubescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/4428/thetubescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img515/356/thetubescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img515/356/thetubescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/8860/thetubescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/8860/thetubescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img192/9601/thetubescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img192/9601/thetubescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img221/1166/thetubescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img221/1166/thetubescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/729/thetubescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img38/729/thetubescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img840/7403/thetubescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img840/7403/thetubescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/5968/thetubescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img820/5968/thetubescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img10/7405/thetubescreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img10/7405/thetubescreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img214/2452/thetubescreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img214/2452/thetubescreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img207/5940/thetubescreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img207/5940/thetubescreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1534 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size:702 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.studentjournals.co.uk/culture/television/806-the-tube-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.studentjournals.co.uk/culture/television/806-the-tube-review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6e807228ae5cdc2aae1abd5b4161023674bb34","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Tube+4of6+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6e807228ae5cdc2aae1abd5b4161023674bb34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,110,128,114,40,174,92,220,42,174,26,189,91,65,97,2,54,116,187,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
