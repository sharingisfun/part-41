There was, however, a turning point for Portuguese history: a memorable year of 1917 and miraculous events that took place about 80 miles northwards from Lisbon, in Fatima. These events, that are the major topic of Fabrizio Costa's movie occurred to be God's light for Portugal, Europe, and the whole world, including, for some time communist, Russia.\n\nMay, the 13th, 1917; three little shepherd children, Lucia (Vanessa Antunes), Jacinta (Vanessa Staiss) and Francisco (Filipe Carvalho) see a Beautiful Lady who claims to come from heaven. She tells them a mystery about later history of the world and calls for prayer and penance. Although children are persecuted and mocked, they come to the very place on every 13th of each month and the popularity of these miracles spreads. They are arrested by municipal authorities (consider a touching moment of a prayer in a prison cell), mocked by journalists; however, all changes on the memorable 13th of October...\n\n\nGeneral Info\n\nCompression: No\nMovie Quality:DVD9\nFile Size:7701 Mb\nAudio Languages:Italian 2.0\nColors\nArea:Pal\nDuration:145 min.\nWide Screen\nSubtitles:Italian\nMenu:Yes\nExtra:Yes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48d36b1f14403cb09455300d72b839ebfff915be","amp;dn":"Fatima+%281997%29+%5BDVD9+-+Ita%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48d36b1f14403cb09455300d72b839ebfff915be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,211,107,31,20,64,60,176,148,85,48,13,114,184,57,235,255,249,21,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
