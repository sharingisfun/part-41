Note this if you burn at high speed u may end up in issues!\n    You can also chose to insall this windows via UFD ( USB Flash Drive ).\n\n    2) How do I install this on a UFD?\n\n    Open the image in Ultra ISO &gt; Select Bootable menu &gt; Select Write Disk Image option. Chose your UFD and start writing.\n\n    3) What is the difference between your windows and normal OS from Microsoft Corporation?\n\n    My Windows is a modified version of Microsoft's. You'll have all the settings preset by me and also you'll have good performance of the OS compared to the native MS'. If you wanna see what tweaks i've made so far, please go throu above section for more details.\n\n    4) After installation can I update my windows?\n\n    After installation you'll have 30 days time to activate your windows. Windows can be activated by online through Microsoft site by paying the amount they charge. This windows is Ultimate version of windows from Microsoft.\n\n    5) I cannot update windows, is this due to your modding?\n\n    Modding has nothing to do with the updates. I haven't removed any dll files other than MCT themes from Microsoft!! So the diagnose is either you are not running a genuine OS or you've disabled it.\n\n    6) You say that you have installed a new boot screen, can I change it?\n\n    Ofcourse you can change your boot screen as many times you want. I have provided a folder by name Prince NRVL EOA applications in Documents Folder. You can see a app called win7bootupdater.exe\n    Run the app and restore the files to normal, then try out your own screens you want.\n\n    7) How do i know that you've not installed or programmed a hacking stuff or bugged into this OS of yours!!\n\n    All my windows are genuine and have not at all bugged with any trojans. My windows are clean and promising performance. There are literally a lot of ppl who are using my windows and been happy with it.\n    NOTE: I have scanned my windows with Mc Afee Total Protection!!\n\n    8) Thanks for your products, how can I show my gratitude to you!!?\n\n    You can pay some money if you want to my paypal account -&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;017173686f62646f73776d41666c60686d2f626e6c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n    Any money sent by you is much appreciated, as u might know this product is a hard work of sleepless nights, energy and many more sacrifices.. So any money sent to my account is much appreciated.\n\n    9) How can I help u other than donating or sending you money (Since i dont have paypal account)\n\n    Well if you don't have a paypal account u can send me money throu some wire transfers or other things. If you don't wanna help me via sending money, you can aid me with sharing the knowledge of yours, may be, GFX or others. You can get me access to seedboxes or servers which eva you can so that I can benefit outta it.\n\n    10) Is the fresh installation always necessary?\n\n    Yes, fresh installation allows the OS to install it properly. All files will be copied on to your HDD unlike upgrade!!\n    And other since the OS' are modded you've to choose this option to install this beauty flawlesly!\n\n\n\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/2406/wsev21.jpg[/img]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/2406/wsev21.jpg[/img]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[img]http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/3450/wsev22q.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/5875/wsev23.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/733/wsev24.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6489/wsev25.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/7910/wsev27.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/3830/wsev28.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/5425/wsev29.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/3366/wsev210.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/3554/wsev211.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6756/wsev212.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/8646/wsev213.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/5149/wsev214.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/5843/wsev215.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/7958/wsev216.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/5268/wsev217.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/4130/wsev218.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1738/wsev219.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/1158/wsev220.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/2003/wsev221.jpg[/img]\n\n\n *Note*\n\n    Well credit the OS properly and share it with your pals.
