Located in the tiny rural town of Butler, Missouri, Muller makes car deals the old fashioned way. No trade or sales stunt, no matter how outrageous or controversial, is off the table if it can help him compete against the big city dealers.\n\nJoined by his brother and business partner, Chicago radio personality Mancow Muller; an oddball staff that works the deals; his wife, Amy, and their sons; Mark takes pride in Max Motors as the embodiment of the values and spirit of the heartland of America.
