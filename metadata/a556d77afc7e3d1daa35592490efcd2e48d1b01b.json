One of its core editorial pillars is news. In the past year, Auto Express has broken 40 world and UK new car exclusives on its front covers, and it is the leading title for first pictures and details of new models. A second pillar is car reviews. The editorial team tests more than 1,100 new cars every year, which is more than any other motoring magazine. The third key editorial pillar is the motorist. Auto Express is a consumer champion for BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 35 million drivers, campaigning on major motoring issues such as fuel tax, insurance cons, speed cameras and safety issues.\n\nAuto Express UK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Issue 1329, 23-29 July 2014\nEnglish | Pages 100 | PDF | 68.4 Mb\n\n\nsupport me fo more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a556d77afc7e3d1daa35592490efcd2e48d1b01b","amp;dn":"Auto+Express+UK+%26ndash%3B+Issue+1329%2C+23-29+July+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a556d77afc7e3d1daa35592490efcd2e48d1b01b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,86,215,122,252,126,61,29,170,53,89,36,144,239,205,46,72,209,176,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
