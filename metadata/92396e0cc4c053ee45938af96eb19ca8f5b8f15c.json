You control Gish, a ball of tar, who uses various powers (such as making himself sticky, slippery, or dense) to avoid traps, smash enemies, and solve puzzles on the way to rescuing his kidnapped lady-friend Brea. Features realistic physics, destructible environments, and a good dose of the bizarre. Every level is packed with secrets, and there are a variety of 2-player battle modes.\n\n\nPlease SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92396e0cc4c053ee45938af96eb19ca8f5b8f15c","amp;dn":"Gish+1.6+%5BUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92396e0cc4c053ee45938af96eb19ca8f5b8f15c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,57,110,12,196,192,83,238,69,147,138,249,110,177,156,168,245,184,241,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
