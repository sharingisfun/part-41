When Joe makes a life-or-death request of the Powers, a favor beyond anything he could have imagined, will they consent...and lift the veil between life and death one last time?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ecf5a3318f81e471d1490177d23ab5b041651b3","amp;dn":"Ten+Grand+012+%282015%29+%28Digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ecf5a3318f81e471d1490177d23ab5b041651b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,207,90,51,24,248,30,71,29,20,144,23,125,35,171,91,4,22,81,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
