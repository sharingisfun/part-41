The world witnesses the start of the Bosnian War, the Olympic torch shines in Barcelona and, in the city, the pound has its darkest day - Black Wednesday.\n\nIn politics, there are upsets in the elections on both sides of the Atlantic, as Labour's Neil Kinnock fails to defeat the incumbent PM John Major, whilst US Democratic candidate Bill Clinton sweeps into White House as George H. W. Bush exits.\n\nOn the radio, Whitney Houston's theme to The Bodyguard breaks records and REM are nominated for seven Grammy Awards. And we're introduced to a whole new vocabulary by the film Wayne's World.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3311f33a99bf8674c3aa113fd4ac2dbb325e30f1","amp;dn":"Sounds+of+the+20th+Century+1992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3311f33a99bf8674c3aa113fd4ac2dbb325e30f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,17,243,58,153,191,134,116,195,170,17,63,212,172,45,187,50,94,48,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
