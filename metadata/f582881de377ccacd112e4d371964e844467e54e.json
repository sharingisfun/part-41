Extracted everything.\r\n\r\nFront cover was created from scan using GIMP: done a 90Â° clockwise rotation and cutted the rear partand the folding traces in the front part. Then the canvas was simmetrically adjusted to make a square image: cut 13 pixels from the top and 13 from the bottom. Saved in .jpg with quality=90 (default).\r\n\r\nSplitted with shnsplit using the following command:\r\n\r\nshnsplit -f CDImage.cue -t '%n. %t' -o ape CDImage.ape \r\n\r\nFile 00. pregap.ape was deleted.\r\n\r\n.ape files were decompressed to their original .wav form, and .wav files were compressed to .flac with higher compression using the original codecs. The codec was then losslessly changed. I used the following script:\r\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nIFS=$'n'\r\nfor f in *.ape; do\r\n\tf=&quot;${f%.*}&quot;\r\n\tmac &quot;$f&quot;.ape &quot;$f&quot;.wav -d\r\n\trm &quot;$f&quot;.ape\r\n\tflac -8 &quot;$f.wav&quot;\r\n\trm &quot;$f&quot;.wav\r\ndone\r\n\r\nThen .flac files were tagged using EasyTag.\r\n\r\nLyrics, got from bennato.net, have been written in LaTeX without front-end, directly with text editor Scite, and compiled with pdflatex. Lyrics of the tenth song were not on the site, but were a piece of the sixth song's lyrics, so they were added manually.\r\n\r\n.torrent file was created with Deluge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f582881de377ccacd112e4d371964e844467e54e","amp;dn":"Edoardo+Bennato+-+La+Torre+di+Babele+%281976%29+%5BFLAC%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f582881de377ccacd112e4d371964e844467e54e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,130,136,29,227,119,204,172,209,18,228,211,113,150,78,132,68,103,229,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
