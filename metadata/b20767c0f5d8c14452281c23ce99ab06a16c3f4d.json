This selects all of its enjoyable tracks and adds relatively classy filler like &quot;Nantucket Sleighride&quot; (heavy-metal myth discovers America) and &quot;The Animal Trainer and the Toad&quot; (one of two songs on this record to mention Beethoven). So I guess it's better. But it's not that much better.&quot; C+\n - Robert Christgau, Village Voice ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b20767c0f5d8c14452281c23ce99ab06a16c3f4d","amp;dn":"Mountain+-+The+Best+of+%281973+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD-A+%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b20767c0f5d8c14452281c23ce99ab06a16c3f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,7,103,192,245,216,193,68,82,40,28,35,206,153,171,6,161,108,63,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
