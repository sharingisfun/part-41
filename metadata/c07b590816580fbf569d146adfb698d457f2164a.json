Similar to the UK system where a pilot is comissioned and\n then later ordered to series. We went with labelling this S01E01 because\n it doesn't look to be a movie. If it were a Syfy movie or miniseries\n they'd advertise the shit out of it and air it constantly. This appeared \n on the schedule just once.\n\n Some links\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://sciencefiction.com/2011/12/29/three-inches-pilot-airs-tonight-on-syfy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://sciencefiction.com/2011/12/29/three-inches-pilot-airs-tonight-on-syfy/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.deadline.com/2010/12/the-case-of-two-similar-pilots-syfys-three-inches-faces-tweeks-possible-half-hour-conversion-to-join-alphas-as-new-series/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.deadline.com/2010/12/the-case-of-two-similar-pilots-syfys-three-inches-faces-tweeks-possible-half-hour-conversion-to-join-alphas-as-new-series/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n                            \n                                                          \n                                                   \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                         \n                                                   \n                          \n                                       \n                                                   \n                                     \n                             \n                         \n                  \n               RESPECT TO        \n        \n       \n       \n         FQM       \n   \n        \n                  2x    \n                        SunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c07b590816580fbf569d146adfb698d457f2164a","amp;dn":"Three.Inches.S01E01.READNFO.HDTV.XviD-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c07b590816580fbf569d146adfb698d457f2164a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,123,89,8,22,88,15,191,86,157,20,106,223,182,152,212,87,242,22,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
