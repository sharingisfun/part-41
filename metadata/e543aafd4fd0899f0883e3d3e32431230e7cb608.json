Released on 26 August 2002 through the label Parlophone in the UK, the album was produced by the band and British record producer Ken Nelson. Recording started after the band became popular in Europe and overseas with the release of their debut album, Parachutes, and, in particular, one of its singles, &quot;Yellow&quot;.[1] Attitudes to songwriting were affected by the September 11 attacks in the United States, which occurred the week before recording started.[2]  The songs featured in the album have a greater use of piano and guitar than its predecessor. In 2003, it was ranked number 473 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.di-arezzo.it/multimedia/images/wise/couv/am975128.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.di-arezzo.it/multimedia/images/wise/couv/am975128.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01.
