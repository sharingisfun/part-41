Mount, burn, or extract the ISO\n2. Install the Microsoft Office applications you want installed. You don't need to install everything if you don't want to. To install Project and/or Visio, you will have to launch setup again and select it.\n3. Run Microsoft Toolkit 2.4.3 as administrator (it should run as administrator by default)\n4. Click Office icon to enter Office Toolkit\n5. Go to Activation tab\n6. Click EZ-Activator button\n7. Enjoy!\n\n#################################################\n\nFAQs\nQ: Is this activation permanent?\nA: The short answer is Yes. Technically this activates office for 180 days, but since it automatically reactivates it, you shall never have to re-activate. It will activate you for 180 days, then another, and then another, and another, and so on for eternity. There is no user interaction with this constant reactivation process, so rest assured that you won't have to worry about activation ever again. There are three things that can mess this up... 1( your antivirus flags it and quarantines/deletes it, 2( Microsoft somehow flags it and deletes it, or 3( you play around and one day ask yourself, &quot;What's this?&quot;, and before you know it you stupidly delete it.\n\nQ: Can I update?\nA: While I cannot guarantee you will not have trouble updating, you generally should be okay installing updates. In simpler terms, yes.\n\nQ: Can I change languages?\nA: Yes. Google is your friend on locating the appropriate language packs.\n\nQ: What is the source of this Office installation?\nA: I took the official retail disk images for Office 2013 Pro Plus, added Visio and Project Professional, and changed the license channel from Retail to Volume.\n\nQ: Is this for 32-bit or 64-bit computers\nA: 64-bit computers only. If you have a pre-existing Office installation that is a 32-bit version, you either will have to uninstall that version or download and use the 32-bit version of Office, which I have uploaded under a similar name.\n\nQ: I'm getting an error that is causing Office activation to fail.\nA: Turn off your antivirus and/or firewall and try again.\n\nQ: May I marry you?\nA: No\n\n#################################################\n\nCredits:\nMicrosoft for Microsoft Office\nCODYQX4 for Microsoft Toolkit\n\n#################################################\n\nIf you enjoy the software, BUY it.
