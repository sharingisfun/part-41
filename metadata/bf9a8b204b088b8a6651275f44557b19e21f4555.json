The partnership was put together by Frontiers President, Serafino Perugino with a vision to unleash another AOR behemoth. \r\n\r\nFIND MEâ€™s debut album, â€œWings of Loveâ€ received excellent reviews and left fans begging for more music from the duo! No demands could have been easier to fulfill as the two guys just love working together and finding the right songs for the group from contributors the likes of Alessandro Del Vecchio, Mark Mangold, brothers Tom and James Martin (Vega, Issa), Soren Kronqvist (Sunstorm), Niclas Olsson (Alyson Avenue) or Philip Lindstrand (Strong) is never a problem. \r\n \r\nâ€œSerafino of Frontiers and I searched for new songs and fresh ideas from writers from all over the worldâ€ tells drummer and producer Daniel Flores. â€œI personally was searching for a musical challenge and Serafino with his golden ears is always looking for the next big song. \r\n\r\nItâ€™s the combination of the two mentalities, with Robbieâ€™s ability to sing and work on melodies that made this album what it is.â€ According to Robbie LaBlanc: â€œDaniel really understands how to create an awesome AOR record. He allows me some flexibility in the melodies and is a pleasure to work with and a true pro.â€\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n1. Road To Nowhere\r\n2. Another World\r\n3.
