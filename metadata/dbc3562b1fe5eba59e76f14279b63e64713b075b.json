Its pretty short and I read the whole thing on my kindle in a day. \n\n\n\nBook Description from Amazon: Dale had everythingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½dream job, dream girl, dream life. When he moved to New York to chase his dreams, he never planned on returning to the Indiana farm where he grew up. Yet, one phone call from his ex-fiance brings him back to face the brothers he abandoned and the consequences of the choices he made in pursuit of those dreams. Will a father's last wish be the key to reuniting a family torn apart by tragedy? Or will Dale lose everything while driving to BelAir.\n\n\n\nIncludes mobi file for Kindle, epub for Nook, Kobo, Sony, and PDF for your computer. There's some other files there too but theyre hard to read and look like crap.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbc3562b1fe5eba59e76f14279b63e64713b075b","amp;dn":"Driving+to+BelAir+-+ALL+SMASHWORDS+FILES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbc3562b1fe5eba59e76f14279b63e64713b075b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,195,86,43,31,229,235,165,158,118,241,66,121,182,62,100,113,59,7,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
