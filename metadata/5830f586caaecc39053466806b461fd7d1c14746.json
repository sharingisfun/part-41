Their doctor has died and they need another one. Helga has medical training, so she's forced to go with them. At first she goes with them unwillingly. She doesn't like them and they don't like her. As the time goes by, she begins to see them as they really are, not anymore as bandits, but as human beings that need her help. And while they are going through mountains and crossing rivers, a new understanding of the people and the land dawn on her. Sometimes they are attacked by German forces. And Helga begins to suspect that maybe things are not so simple as she once thought. She's doesn't know anymore where she belongs.\n\nThis subject could have easily led to a maudlin or preachy film, but &quot;Die Letzte BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼cke&quot; avoids these traps. &quot;Die Letzte BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼cke&quot; manages to convey emotion through a skillful use of images and words - close-ups on Maria Schell's face, on other faces, the mountains, the rivers, the bridges. When partisan commandant Boro (Bernhard Wicki) and Helga are passing by a cemetery, he says to Helga: &quot;Here are buried the German soldiers&quot;, and then, with a wide gesture, showing the landscape, mountains and all, he says: &quot;and there are buried our people, my people, our land&quot;. As you see, images and words work together, the emotion conveyed by them is deep, but the film is not at all melodramatic.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Die letzte Bruecke.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.36 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 38mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 991 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 1 789 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 512 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.203\n      Stream size : 1.22 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 135 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0047172\n\nGerman audio; English, Spanish, Portuguese srt, multilanguage subpack (German, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Japanese, Russian)\n\nHelmut Kautner - Die letzte Bruecke [1954]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5830f586caaecc39053466806b461fd7d1c14746","amp;dn":"Helmut+Kautner+-+Die+letzte+Bruecke+%5B1954%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5830f586caaecc39053466806b461fd7d1c14746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,48,245,134,202,174,204,57,5,52,102,128,107,70,31,215,209,193,71,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
