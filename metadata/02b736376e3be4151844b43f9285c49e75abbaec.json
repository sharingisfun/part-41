Now Jennie is in search of a simpler life, as she moves her family to a seven-acre farm in the countryside of Central California, where she hopes to put the pressures of Hollywood aside and experience a new way of life. It's a move that will either give her the all-American lifestyle she has always dreamed of, or turn her family's world completely upside down.\n\n\n\nNote -- The first episode I couldn't find in any format except .flv so I just converted it to a .mp4. Let me know if there are any issues and I can just upload the original .flv if so. I will be uploading the rest of the season this week. :)\n\nThank you to the original cappers of these files!
