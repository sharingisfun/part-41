Four\nnew tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Pink Cashmere,&quot; &quot;Peach,&quot; &quot;Pope&quot;, and &quot;Power Fantastic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are also included.\n\nDisc one and two were released separately, under the titles The Hits 1 and The Hits 2\nrespectively, but the B-Sides disc could only be obtained by purchasing the full set. Most of\nthe songs (A-sides and B-sides) on The Hits/The B-Sides are represented in their single\n(edited) form, but this was necessary due to time constraints, and the nature of a greatest-hits\ncollection. Exceptions to this were &quot;Alphabet St.,&quot; &quot;Little Red Corvette,&quot; &quot;Sexy M.F.,&quot;and\n&quot;Purple Rain.&quot; This was also the first time the single version of &quot;Kiss&quot; was available on CD.\nThe third disc of B-sides also featured the 7&quot; edits, with the exceptions of &quot;200 Balloons,&quot; &quot;17\nDays,&quot; &quot;Gotta Stop (Messin' About),&quot; &quot;Horny Toad,&quot; &quot;Feel U Up,&quot; &quot;I Love U In Me,&quot; &quot;God,&quot; and\n&quot;How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore?,&quot; which were all original full-length recordings from\nthe original singles.\n\nAmong the previously unreleased material was the rare, live version of &quot;4 the Tears In Your\nEyes,&quot; only previously released in a 1985 TV broadcast for the Live Aid concerts. Also\nincluded was a live version of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U,&quot; recorded live January 27, 1992 at\nPaisley Park with the New Power Generation. The other four new tracks were outtakes. The\noldest track was &quot;Power Fantastic,&quot; a moody ballad once considered for the Dream Factory\nproject of 1986. Another ballad, &quot;Pink Cashmere,&quot; was broadcast before some of the\nLovesexy Tours, dating it back to 1988. &quot;Peach&quot; and &quot;Pope&quot; were more recent, and both were\nplayed live during some 1993 after shows. &quot;Pope&quot; was actually in the short-lived musical\nballet, Glam Slam Ulysses, which also spawned several songs later released on Come and\nThe Gold Experience. Live jams of &quot;Peach&quot; often extended into the title track for Chaos and\nDisorder.\n\nWhile Prince had very little interest in the project, he insisted that his longtime manager Alan\nLeeds write the liner notes over Rolling Stone journalist Neal Karlen. According to Prince\nbiographer Per Nilsen, the record company actually had paid to Prince not get involved with\nthe making of this compilation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1 (The Hits 1)\n\n\n\n1. &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48 (single edit)\n2. &quot;Pop Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n3. &quot;Soft and Wet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03\n4. &quot;I Feel for You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n5. &quot;Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n6. &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n7. &quot;Uptown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09 (single edit)\n8. &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n9. &quot;1999&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37 (single edit)\n10. &quot;I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 (single edit)\n11. &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58 (previously unreleased)\n12. &quot;Adore&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41 (edit)\n13. &quot;Pink Cashmere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:15 (previously unreleased)\n14. &quot;Alphabet St.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n15. &quot;Sign &quot;?&quot; the Times&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43 (single edit)\n16. &quot;Thieves in the Temple&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n17. &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20 (single edit)\n18. &quot;7&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1 (The Hits 2)\n\n\n\n\n1. &quot;Controversy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 (single edit)\n2. &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n3. &quot;I Wanna Be Your Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58 (single edit)\n4. &quot;Head&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n5. &quot;Do Me, Baby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57 (single edit)\n6. &quot;Delirious&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:39 (single edit)\n7. &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n8. &quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57 (single edit)\n9. &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n10. &quot;If I Was Your Girlfriend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 (single edit)\n11. &quot;Kiss&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 (single edit)\n12. &quot;Peach&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48 (previously unreleased)\n13. &quot;U Got the Look&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n14. &quot;Sexy M.F.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n15. &quot;Gett Off&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n16. &quot;Cream&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n17. &quot;Pope&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28 (previously unreleased)\n18. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:40\n\n\n\n\nDisc 3 (The B-Sides)\n\n\n\n1. &quot;Hello&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24 (edit) (B-side of &quot;Pop Life&quot;)\n2. &quot;200 Balloons&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06 (B-side of &quot;Batdance&quot;)\n3. &quot;Escape (Free yo mind from this rat race)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30 (edit) (B-side of &quot;Glam Slam&quot;)\n4. &quot;Gotta Stop (Messin' About)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55 (B-side of &quot;Let's Work&quot; 12 inch single)\n5. &quot;Horny Toad&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:12 (B-side of &quot;Delirious&quot;)\n6. &quot;Feel U Up (Short Stroke)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 (edit) (B-side of &quot;Partyman&quot;)\n7. &quot;Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48 (edit) (B-side of &quot;America&quot;)\n8. &quot;I Love U In Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13 (B-side of &quot;The Arms of Orion&quot; and &quot;Insatiable&quot;)\n9. &quot;Erotic City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 (edit) (B-side of &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;)\n10. &quot;Shockadelica&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31 (edit) (B-side of &quot;If I Was Your Girlfriend&quot;)\n11. &quot;Irresistible Bitch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12 (B-side of &quot;Let's Pretend We're Married&quot;)\n12. &quot;Scarlett Pussy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 (edit) (B-side of &quot;I Wish U Heaven&quot;)\n13. &quot;La, La, La, He, He, Hee&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 (edit) (B-side of &quot;Sign &quot;?&quot; the Times&quot;)\n14. &quot;She's Always In My Hair&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 (edit) (B-side of &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;)\n15. &quot;17 Days (the rain will come down, then U will have 2 choose.
