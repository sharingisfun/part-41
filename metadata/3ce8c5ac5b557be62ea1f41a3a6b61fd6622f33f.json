THE REST OF THE LESSONS, 19-109, ARE ENGLISH -- TRASLATION THAT IS.\n\nOPINION:\n\n2. The audio for this course is quite horrendous: slow throughout, actors/voices are poetic, and the dialogs don't link (sometimes within themselves). Better off using &quot;Spanish Without Toil&quot; (b/w pdf &amp; audio available online) or L'espagnol sans peine (new version -- more lively).\n\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce8c5ac5b557be62ea1f41a3a6b61fd6622f33f","amp;dn":"Assimil+-+Spanish+with+Ease+%281987%29+pdf++-+English+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce8c5ac5b557be62ea1f41a3a6b61fd6622f33f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,232,197,172,91,85,123,230,46,161,244,26,58,107,97,253,102,34,243,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
