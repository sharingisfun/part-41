The album was released in 1998 for Priority Records and was produced by Dr. Dre, DJ Yella and Craig B. The album was mildly successful, making it to #142 on the Billboard 200 and #31 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop album charts. Artists on the album include MC Eiht, Dresta, King Tee, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Snoop Dogg, C-Murder and Jayo Felony. The only single and video was MC Eiht, Dresta and King Tee's remake of Straight Outta Compton.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; (King Tee, MC Eiht &amp; Dresta)- 4:11\n2. &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; (Bone Thugs N Harmony)- 5:01\n3. &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot; (Snoop Dogg &amp; C-Murder)- 4:39\n4. &quot;If It Ain't Ruff&quot; (WC)- 3:43\n5. &quot;Parental Discretion Iz Advised&quot; (Comrads, Allfrumtha I &amp; Boo Kapone)- 4:18\n6. &quot;8 Ball&quot; (Jayo Felony)- 4:24\n7. &quot;Something Like That&quot; (J Dubb &amp; Ant Banks)- 3:14\n8. &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (Silkk the Shocker)- 4:22\n9. &quot;Compton's N the House&quot; (live) (N.W.A.)- 2:01\n10. &quot;I Ain't Tha 1&quot; (Mr. Mike)- 5:28\n11. &quot;Dopeman&quot; (Mack 10)- 4:00\n12. &quot;Quiet on Tha Set&quot; (Big Pun, Fat Joe &amp; Cuban Link) 4:00\n\n\nThey were called &quot;the world's most dangerous group&quot; for a reason. It wasn't just good to be bad when it came to Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, DJ Yella and Ice Cube: It was life-altering. It feels almost criminal to categorize N.W.A as merely a group. They were and are a state of mind, a lifestyle, a movement. With all the dope-selling, the graphic sex and violence in their lyrics, N.W.A were like voices from the other side of the ghetto. While the East Coast was dominating hip-hop, the ghetto-entrenched narratives of N.W.A's 1989 breakthrough, Straight Outta Compton, introduced society to a whole different 'hood mentality. Ice Cube in particular could make you feel like you were standing on the corner of Crenshaw and Slauson in South Central L.A. with a 40-ounce in your hand, getting ready to duck the swing of a bigoted cop's baton. Lyrically, the underrated MC Ren was right on his heels ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? so cold-hearted in his delivery and remorselessly precise with his bars.\n\nThe group's influence has reached far beyond its songs. With Ruthless Records, the late Eazy-E helped to design the template for the independent rap-label hustle. Hollywood has become so enamored of the former public enemy number-one Ice Cube that he now stars in kids' flicks. And Dre has become simply the greatest hip-hop producer of all time, helping to launch the careers of Snoop Dogg, the D.O.C., Eminem and 50 Cent, among others ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? and Eazy didn't do too badly for himself, with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71b7d7e7e5bee6e6d67e7efe4449b7bd127f1847","amp;dn":"Straight+Outta+Compton%3A+N.W.A.+10th+Anniversary+Tribute+%28EXPLICI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71b7d7e7e5bee6e6d67e7efe4449b7bd127f1847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,183,215,231,229,190,230,230,214,126,126,254,68,73,183,189,18,127,24,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
