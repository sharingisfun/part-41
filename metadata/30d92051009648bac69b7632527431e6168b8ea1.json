Thus, in 1989, the Hart organ was purchased and installation began in St Lawrence church that autumn.\n\nTibor Pinter plays Voluntaries by John Stanley, Jeremiah Clarke, William Boyce and Maurice Green on the sample set of the original instrument.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30d92051009648bac69b7632527431e6168b8ea1","amp;dn":"The+Hart+Organ+of+Little+Waldingfield+-+Stanley+Clarke+Boyce+Gre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30d92051009648bac69b7632527431e6168b8ea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,217,32,81,0,150,72,186,198,155,118,50,82,116,49,230,22,139,142,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
