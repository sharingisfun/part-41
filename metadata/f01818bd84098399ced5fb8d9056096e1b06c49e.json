The album's got a pretty laidback vibe, which is great Ã¢â‚¬â€œ almost in the same space as The Temprees, with an undercurrent of super-dope arrangements, and Ernie's lead vocals right up front in the mix! There's a bit of strings on the set, and most tracks have some sort of harmony support behind Hines' lead Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a vibe that's a bit different, and maybe almost more east coast than the usual Stax set. Arrangements are by Wardell Quezquerque, Dale Warren, Lester Snell, and Tom Nixon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and both The Bar Kays and The MGs play on the record. Titles include the sample classic &quot;Our Generation&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus &quot;Electrified Love&quot;, &quot;Sugar Plum&quot;, &quot;Change Is Gonna Come&quot;, &quot;Your Love (Is All I Need)&quot;, and &quot;Come On Y'All&quot;.
