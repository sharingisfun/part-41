Literary icon Thomas Pynchon is a Lotion fan, so he contributed a brief appreciative essay to this, their sophomore album. It is a testament to the group's talent and artistry that their songs hold up alongside Pynchon's hip, elaborate prose. Nobody's Cool retains the densely layered sound of their debut, but it's a tighter, more accessible set. For &quot;Rock Chick,&quot; the band adds kitschy-loungey touches reminiscent of the Cardigans to a typically complex song structure, then tops it all off with an electric piano outro, proving that they have more than a few tricks left up their collective sleeve. &quot;Precious Tiny&quot; rides a glorious five-minute mess of a guitar solo into the post-modern sunset, with crashing drums, distant background vocals, and a plinking banjo for company. Throughout Nobody's Cool, lyrics yield meanings more readily than they do on 1994's Full Isaac. &quot;Sandra,&quot; for instance, is narrated by a lovelorn stalker. The result is an album that is even more memorable and engaging than its predecessor, a veritable tour de force. Fans of Galaxie 500, HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼, My Bloody Valentine, and R.E.M. can be grateful that Lotion is around to carry the torch for forward-thinking indie rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3da7ed63205448f0863b883b3adf6e26d7b3b2d","amp;dn":"Lotion+-+Nobody%27s+Coll+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3da7ed63205448f0863b883b3adf6e26d7b3b2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,218,126,214,50,5,68,143,8,99,184,131,179,173,246,226,109,123,59,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
