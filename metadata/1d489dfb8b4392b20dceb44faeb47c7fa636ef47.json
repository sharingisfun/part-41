Issues 260-329 (final issue), running from 1979-1986.\n\nSnipped from Wikipedia:\nIn 1980, under the pen of Gerry Conway, Steve Trevor was brought back to life a second time. Following Diana&amp;#039;s renunciation of her role as Wonder Woman, a version of Steve Trevor from an undisclosed portion of the Multiverse accidentally made the transition to Earth-One. With Diana&amp;#039;s memory erased by the Mists of Nepenthe, the new Steve again crash-landed and arrived at Paradise Island. After reclaiming the title of Wonder Woman, Diana returned to Military Intelligence, working with Trevor and re-joined by supporting characters Etta Candy and General Darnell.\n\nIn the preview in DC Comics Presents #41 (January 1982), writer Roy Thomas and penciller Gene Colan provided Wonder Woman with a stylized &quot;WW&quot; emblem on her bodice, and replaced the more popular eagle. The &quot;W&quot; emblem, unlike the eagle, could be protected as a trademark and so had greater merchandising potential. Many fans denounced the new emblem as a generic rip-off of Superman&amp;#039;s &quot;S&quot; emblem.\n\nAfter the departure of Thomas in 1982, Dan Mishkin took over writing chores, writing the character with more confidence than had been seen in years, and producing stories that often took surprising and challenging turns.\n\nHowever, sales of the title continued to decline. Shortly after Mishkin&amp;#039;s departure in 1985 (and a 3-issue run by Mindy Newell, along with a well-publicized but never-published revamp by Steve Gerber[13]), the series ended with issue # 329 (February 1986). Penned by Gerry Conway, the final issue depicted Wonder Woman&amp;#039;s marriage to Steve Trevor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d489dfb8b4392b20dceb44faeb47c7fa636ef47","amp;dn":"Wonder+Woman+v1+pt5+260-329+%28%5C%2779-%5C%2786%29%28Catseye2001%29+%5Bh33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d489dfb8b4392b20dceb44faeb47c7fa636ef47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,72,157,251,139,67,146,178,13,206,180,79,174,180,124,127,166,54,239,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
