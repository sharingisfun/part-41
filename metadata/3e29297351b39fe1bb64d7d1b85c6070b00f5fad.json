Carl Anderson stars as Judas, who has begun to believe that Jesus (Ted Neeley) has sold out and started buying into the mythology that&amp;#039;s quickly springing up around him. Particularly disturbing to Judas is the relationship between Jesus and his friend Mary Magdalene (Yvonne Elliman), a prostitute. When Jesus throws a temper tantrum at the moneylenders in a temple, Judas determines to work with the Pharisees who want to put Jesus on trial as a false prophet. Following his success with the adaptation of Fiddler on the Roof (1971), director Norman Jewison experimented with a hippie-influenced sensibility on Jesus Christ Superstar (1973).\n\nMore details: www.solodvd.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e29297351b39fe1bb64d7d1b85c6070b00f5fad","amp;dn":"Jesus+Christ+Superstar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e29297351b39fe1bb64d7d1b85c6070b00f5fad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,41,41,115,81,179,159,225,187,100,215,209,184,92,96,112,176,15,95,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
