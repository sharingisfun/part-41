For the artists it was a chance to experience what it was like to record in those early days and to also experience what it might have been like to have had Alan Lomax record them.\n\nAbout the experience, Richard Thompson said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Man. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everything I was saying about emotional. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a whole other thing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92606ebec6ac4546d0cbb2e35354d6054765b0a6","amp;dn":"VA+-+The+78+Project+Volume+1+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92606ebec6ac4546d0cbb2e35354d6054765b0a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,96,110,190,198,172,69,70,208,203,178,227,83,84,214,5,71,101,176,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
