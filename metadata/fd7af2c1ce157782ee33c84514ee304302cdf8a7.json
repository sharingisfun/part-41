I found these Ã¢â‚¬Å“at the back of a drawerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on my hard disk so thought I would share them now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t open your download until Christmas, otherwise Santa may not come callingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nThese are four stories, each read by Tom Conti, and with a Christmas theme:\n\n1) The Blue Carbuncle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\nA well known Sherlock Holmes tale of a stolen diamond discovered inside a Christmas goose.\n\n2) The Thieves Who CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Help Sneezing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Thomas Hardy\t\t\nNot the sort of thing one thinks of from Thomas Hardy, this is the story of horse thieves and house breakers in Wessex.\n\n3) The Necklace Of Pearls Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dorothy L Sayers\nNot my favourite author or favourite detective, Lord Peter Wimsey finds himself as usual in a country house\n\n4) The Flying Stars Ã¢â‚¬â€œ G K Chesterton\nFather Brown finds himself involved with Pantomime people.
