A sand storm kicks in, and Shaggy makes an accidental turn into government property. The sight of a UFO causes Shaggy to lose control of the vehicle, and find themselves on the outskirts of a small town. While Scooby and Shaggy stay with the van, the rest of the gang walks into a local diner to ask for directions. Shaggy and Scooby then encounter a fictional animal called a jackalope. Shaggy and Scooby run in the diner in panic while the Scooby-Doo, Where are You theme song (sang by Jennifer Love Hewitt) is played, claiming to have seen aliens.\n\n\n\nThis is a Perfect quality dvd rip\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253658/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253658/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIll be back to seed soon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af62d4ce3d2168c7079040e566a125abb0ecea25","amp;dn":"+Scooby-Doo+and+the+Alien+Invaders+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af62d4ce3d2168c7079040e566a125abb0ecea25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,98,212,206,61,33,104,199,7,144,64,229,102,161,37,171,176,236,234,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
