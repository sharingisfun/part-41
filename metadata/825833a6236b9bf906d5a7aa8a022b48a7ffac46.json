Kaz suspects the gym teacher, Mr. Patterson, is the super villain Dr. Wrath, because he saw him walk through a solid door, and Dr. Wrath feeds on negative energy. Kaz confronts him during detention, and accidentally paralyzes him. However, Skylar reveals that he's actually a secret superhero agent. Kaz then wonders who Dr. Wrath is, when Stephanie reveals it is her, and ties Kaz and Skylar up in negative chains, but they escape by saying positive things about each other. Skylar fights Stephanie while Kaz messes with her ionic blaster. It turns out that Kaz reversed the polarity and caused the blaster to release positive energy instead of negative energy. Dr. Wrath morphs into his real form and disintegrates. The agent arrives and and takes Dr. Wrath away, and Gus reveals the real Stephanie was locked in a closet with no memory. Meanwhile, Oliver tries to fulfill a community service project through Alan by getting him to try Normo food. He succeeds, but Normo food has strange side effects from eating it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:825833a6236b9bf906d5a7aa8a022b48a7ffac46","amp;dn":"Mighty.Med.S01E17.Mighty.Mad.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-TVSmash.mk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"825833a6236b9bf906d5a7aa8a022b48a7ffac46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,88,51,166,35,107,155,249,6,213,167,170,138,2,43,72,167,255,172,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
