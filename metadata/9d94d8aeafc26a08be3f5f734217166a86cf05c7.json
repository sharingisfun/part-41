He never made it home, the tragic victim of an alleged 'overdoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Two weeks later, Ernesto's son, Ramiro Cruz is hauled out of jail by the DEA to be told his twin brother, Tommy, works for them as an undercover agent and has some new information about their father's death. But, Tommy has had an accident with a hand grenade and now Ramiro must take his brother's place in an undercover operation closing in on the ruthless drug cartel overlord Papa Muerte.\n\nTake control of Ramiro Cruz, a man on a crazy mission through Mexico's drug-fuelled underworld. An amazing combat system keeps the action intense, mixing third person action with an incredible combo system for maximum carnage - and maximum replayability. Hilarious special moves and a huge amount of weaponry makes Total Overdose as frantic and fun an adventure as you could ever hope to find, and a red-hot latin soundtrack fits the action perfectly. This can be the perfect Latino gangsta sandbox game you were looking for all your life!\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d94d8aeafc26a08be3f5f734217166a86cf05c7","amp;dn":"Total+Overdose+A+Gunslingers+Tale+In+Mexico+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d94d8aeafc26a08be3f5f734217166a86cf05c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,148,216,174,175,194,106,8,190,63,95,115,66,23,22,106,134,207,5,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
