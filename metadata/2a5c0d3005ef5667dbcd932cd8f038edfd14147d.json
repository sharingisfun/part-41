As with previous titles focusing on Aerosmith and Metallica, Guitar Hero: Van Halen features 3D modeled versions of each band member as well as signature-style moves, clothing, and instruments from the past and present. Complete a solo tour on bass, guitar, drums, or vocals, or team up with up to three friends for the full band experience. In addition to Van Halen's biggest hits, 19 songs from such artists as Queen, Weezer, blink-182, the Offspring, and Queens of the Stone Age are included. Among the 25 featured songs from Van Halen are &quot;Jump,&quot; &quot;Hot for Teacher,&quot; &quot;Panama,&quot; &quot;Little Guitars,&quot; &quot;Cathedral,&quot; &quot;Spanish Fly,&quot; and &quot;Eruption.&quot; \n\nEnjoy &amp; Comments are always welcome\n\nNOTE:\nCompressed with 7-zip\nDownload for the compression tool can be found here:\nhttp://www.7-zip.org\n\n\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nDVD-5 Ripkit is now out (thanks to Drakia)\nDownload can be found here:\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://host-a.net/CivicScootin/PS2%20GHVanHalen%20DVD-5%20RipKit-Drake.7z&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=0 src=&quot;http://host-a.net/CivicScootin/PS2%20GHVanHalen%20DVD-5%20RipKit-Drake.7z/link.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLater,\nCivic/Scootin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a5c0d3005ef5667dbcd932cd8f038edfd14147d","amp;dn":"Guitar+Hero+Van+Halen+%28NTSC-USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a5c0d3005ef5667dbcd932cd8f038edfd14147d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,92,13,48,5,239,86,103,219,205,147,44,216,240,56,237,253,20,20,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
