After she returned home from Afghanistan and caught her husband in bed with the nanny, Kennedy lost her faith in men and started Fool Me Once Investigations with her two best friends. After all, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no better bounty hunter than a woman scorned.\n\nWhen Kennedy takes a case to slap cuffs on a bail jumper turned dog-napper, she figures itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be an easy paycheck. But trouble has a way of finding Kennedy. Enter the last man on the planet sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d willingly choose as a partner: her cheating ex-husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend, Griffin Crawford.\n\nAs gorgeous as he is unwelcome, Griffin has always had a thing for Kennedy, and after keeping quiet about her exÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cheating, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do anything to earn back her trust. Whether or not she wants to admit it, Kennedy will need help as the case of the Chihuahua thief spirals out of control. Griffin may be just her manÃ¢â‚¬â€in more ways than one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b25a1cca2a225200bedd5d4913d13992ed47ebc8","amp;dn":"Shame+On+You+-+Tara+Sivec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b25a1cca2a225200bedd5d4913d13992ed47ebc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,90,28,202,42,34,82,0,190,221,93,73,19,209,57,146,237,71,235,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
