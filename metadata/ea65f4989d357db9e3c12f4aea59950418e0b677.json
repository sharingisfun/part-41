Some critics gave the album positive reviews; Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters commented that the band was a &quot;far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late&quot;, and claimed that &quot;they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds.&quot;\n\n* The music that would ultimately become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and imprasario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on melrose .\n\n* Linkin Park was formed in 1999 when lead vocalist Chester Bennington joined the five members of the rock group Xero: guitarist Brad Delson, MC Mike Shinoda, drummer Rob Bourdon, turntablist Joe Hahn, and bassist Dave Farrell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea65f4989d357db9e3c12f4aea59950418e0b677","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Hybrid+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea65f4989d357db9e3c12f4aea59950418e0b677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,101,244,152,157,53,125,185,227,193,47,74,234,89,149,4,24,224,182,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
