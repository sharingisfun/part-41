So close that they live next door to one another with facing second story windows and share a birthday. Tucker is at times an absent minded goof-off while Becca tends to be opinated and in a hurry to grow up. Now in middle school, they find themselves caught in everyday events that turn into comical adventures. Throughout the show, Tucker, Becca, and their friends speak directly to the audience, telling the story as they remember how much more simple everything was when they were five. If they can survive junior high, then their friendship can survive anything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f42594adcc2f7b02a57ecaa17fb4729e89571a70","amp;dn":"Flash+Forward-DlSNEY+1996+with+Tucker+and+Becca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f42594adcc2f7b02a57ecaa17fb4729e89571a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,37,148,173,204,47,123,2,165,126,202,161,127,180,114,158,137,87,26,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
