Create ideas, make changes without stopping, and capture everything as you work.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used music software before, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already familiar with with one half of Ableton Live. LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Arrangement View is a familiar working space: time moves from left to right, while tracks are stacked vertically.\n\nBut Live also features the revolutionary Session View: a unique sketchpad for improvising, playing and performing with musical ideas, without the constraints of the timeline. Freely and independently start and stop any number of audio or MIDI loops Ã¢â‚¬â€œ everything stays in sync. Almost everything in Live works in real-time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ add, reorder or remove devices, play with LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexible track routing and more Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all without interrupting your creative flow.\n\n\nVersion 9.0.4:\n\n    VST / AU plug-in devices could be inactive after loading a Live set containing a large number of plug-ins (regression in Live 9.0.3).\n    The Ã¢â‚¬Å“grab_controlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ function which allows to gain control over a control surfaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s button matrix via Max for Live would not work anymore (regression in Live 9.0.3).\n    Fixed a bug which could cause the File Manager window to reopen after launching Live.\n\nNOTE: Instructions inside.\n      Pack contain both X32 and X64 !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4690e9dcf2619df8109263e3071028e342fd9a94","amp;dn":"Ableton+Live+9+Suite+v9.0.4+MacOSX-IO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4690e9dcf2619df8109263e3071028e342fd9a94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,144,233,220,242,97,157,248,16,146,99,227,7,16,40,227,66,253,154,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
