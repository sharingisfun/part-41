Namely, when the work of several careers and hobbies like teaching, welding and social work was done. After retirement gave him more chances for picking and singing, Avett recorded this album as a joyous excuse to work with his own children and to create a keepsake for their children.\n\nA must have for any Avett Brothers fan, listen to the man who inspired and taught Seth and Scott.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:086c7e3f235f594b3dd405b21234e449257146a4","amp;dn":"Jim+Avett+and+Family","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"086c7e3f235f594b3dd405b21234e449257146a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,108,126,63,35,95,89,75,61,212,5,178,18,52,228,73,37,113,70,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
