Travis DeVries' vocals blend Ian Brown's nonchalance ('Northern Lad') and Gordon Gano/Brett Anderson's cracked hysteria ('Days Ahead', 'Somewhere in My World'), with elements of Galaxie 500's washed-out dreaminess. The album also includes first single 'Summer's Dead', with its anthemic riff akin to a slightly dialled-down British Sea Power, out on 5th May.Eastern Hollows are Travis DeVries (vocals, guitar), Martin Glazier (vocals,guitar), Sean Gibbons (guitar), Brian Brennan (bass), and Jeremy Sampson(drums.). DeVries assembled Eastern Hollows following his success with The Turn-ons playing sold-out shows with The Strokes and Interpol and touted by Peter Buck as his, &quot;favourite new Seattle band&quot; [Q]. A string of east coast shows laid the groundwork for a digital release, 'Days Ahead EP', in 2012. The tracks for the album were recorded in summer 2013 with Chris Pace (Smoke and Mirrors) and mastered by Adam Straney (BreakPointMastering). Travis's solo project 'deVries' released 'Death to God' on Noise on Noise to widespread acclaim: legendary producer Kramer (Galaxie 500, Low, Sufjan Stevens) declared the album, &quot;fucking genius,&quot; The Deli called It, &quot;a fine shoegaze-pop record,'' and Incendiary proclaimed it, &quot;possibly the greatest Manchester album never to have been made in Manchester.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e71bc62c0b76c2c2a4325dfe0f4fa4f6cee059bc","amp;dn":"Eastern+Hollows+-+Eastern+Hollows+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e71bc62c0b76c2c2a4325dfe0f4fa4f6cee059bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,27,198,44,11,118,194,194,164,50,93,254,15,79,164,246,206,224,89,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
