No central authority exists. Rulers strive to acquire the slimmest advantage in the struggle to secure their holdings and, if fortune smiles upon them, expand. \n\nEvery region has had at least one period like this, but what if such periods occurred simultaneously throughout the world on the cusp of the Age of Discovery? Rather than a way for the powerful to exploit their advantage, exploration could be used by small states to ensure their very survival. Form a power base and subjugate those who stand in your path toward regional suzerainty, but beware the rapidly shifting political landscape. \n\n\nCurrent version: v1.20 - compatible with Patch 1.7 \nMay not be compatible with other mods. \n\n\nObjectives:\nAn emphasis on creating unique and challenging gameplay situations inspired by a variety of historical eras. \nDynamic political landscape in which a wide variety of claimants could reasonably become great powers. \nEnhanced political system including a greater variety and significance of government types, dynastic takeovers, assassination, and a more nuanced approach to vassals.\n\n\nPresent State:\nThe world is inhabited by many more moderate powers, like Nizhny Novgorod, Transylvania, and Persia. Provincial ownership has been rebalanced to allow nations like Perm or Bulgaria to become the dominant regional power in place of Muscovy or the Ottomans. Non-Western tech penalties have been slightly adjusted with this same goal in mind. \nNew European countries include the Latin Empire, Nicaea, Thessalonica, ValÃƒÂ¨ncia, LeÃƒÂ³n, Toledo, Murcia, Badajoz, JaÃƒÂ©n, Seville, Algarve, Mide, and CÃƒÂ³rdoba (by national decision). \nNew Asian countries include the Han Claimants of Wu, Wei, and Shu, as well as their fifteen vassals. The Korean contenders are Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje, while the Manchu Tribes are Haixi, Jianzhou, and the Wild Jurchens. Two new Southeast Asian powers have arisen: Len Shun and Sengkor. \nThe New World has been inhabited by native tribes as well as Chinese, Swedish, and Norwegian expeditions. \nThe HRE has been mostly dissolved to promote dynamism in Europe. \nNew national ideas for Iberian, East Asian, French, British Isles, and even more countries. \nNew national decisions to form the Latin Empire, the Crown of Castile, the Crown of Aragon, the Caliphate of CÃƒÂ³rdoba, Ming China, the Manchu nation, Korea, and more. \nTimeline extended to 1/1/9000 \nOver 200 new provinces \nSeveral new government types including Principalities, Manchu Hordes, Han Claimants, and unique governments for the vassals of each Claimant. \nThe vassal system has been changed to promote long-term vassals. Annexation is now limited through events, meaning that AI overlords wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t annex all of their vassals within the first couple of decades. Vassals are also eager to expand their own power in this age of weak central authority and those of the same overlord may declare war on or form alliances with each other. \nDynastic conflicts are more common and less likely to anger neighbors, who view them as internal disputes, due to the new Dynastic Superiority casus belli and war type. \nDiplomatic relationships at our start date of January 1, 1445 have been completely wiped apart from those introduced by this mod. National decisions and events that cause personal unions have been removed (e.g., Burgundian Succession, Iberian Wedding, Poland-Lithuania). \nIncludes an adaptation of xcrissxcrossxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Principalities mod for dynamic ruler title changes. \nIncludes an adaptation of knuckeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dynamic Colony Name Change mod. \nIncludes an adaptation of sinkingmist's Coalition Vassal mod. \nThanks to Baldwin XI for his contribution to unique national ideas.\n\nWe'll be focusing on flavor events, missions, and decisions for a growing cast of nations as time goes on. \n\n\nEast Asia\nMing has been split into the three kingdoms of Wei, Wu, and Shu. Each of the three kingdoms is destined to fight for their claim over China, battling each other while engaging in foreign affairs with the neighboring countries. The five vassals of each kingdom go to war with eachother for more land, eventually aiming for indepence. The greatest of the three kingdoms can establish the Han Dynasty, although other dynasties are available. \n\nManchu has been divided into Jianzhou, Haixi, and the Wild Jurchens. Each can form Manchu. \n\nKorea has divided into three parts: Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje. Each can unify Korea. \n\n\nIberia\nIberia is inspired by its late eleventh and twelfth century history. The JimÃƒÂ©nez dynasty controls Navarre, Castile, LeÃƒÂ³n, and Galicia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each attempting to assert its dominance over the dynastic lands. Both LeÃƒÂ³n and Castile have vassals that rule over newly conquered, and often unstable, territory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Toledo, Murcia, JaÃƒÂ©n, and Badajoz. In Catalan lands, the Megani dynasty rules in Catalonia and Valencia. New national decisions allow Castillian countries to form the Crown of Castile and Catalan countries to form the Crown of Aragon once their dynastic land is united. New unique national ideas exist for Galicia and Navarre, and the Iberian Christian group encompasses the other new countries. Also, Andalucia is larger and inhabited by the Taifas of Seville and Algarve (joining Granada). By uniting Al-Andalus, one of the Taifas can restore the Caliphate of CÃƒÂ³rdoba. \n\n\nNear East\nThe Near East reflects the conflict between Byzantine Successors and Crusader States directly following the Fourth Crusade. New countries include the Empire of Nicaea, Latin Empire, and Kingdom of Thessalonica. The Byzantine Empire can be reformed by any of the three Imperial successors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nicaea, Trebizond, and Epirus Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or Morea. If the Latin Empire should fall, any Catholic country with Greek holdings can restore it. Also, the Kingdom of Jerusalem exists, though in a precarious position between major Muslim powers. \n\n\nFrance and the British Isles\nIn France, the landscape is inspired by the eleventh century during which power resided with effectively independent regional Dukes rather than the King. A new French Lords national idea group encompasses countries from Normandy to Provence. \n\nThe British Isles reflects an alternative-history War of the Roses. The Plantagenet dynasty rules in the Duchies of York, Lancaster, and Cornwall. Northumbria (inspired by pre-Norman England), Wales, and Mide (Ireland) took this opportunity to declare their independence. The Duke of Normandy claimed that the vacant throne of England ought to be his, on questionable grounds, and managed to conquer Kent and London. England may be formed by any of the Plantagenet contenders, Normandy, or Northumbria. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b59e4a468ad463d8a47b73c74b69b314db74bc03","amp;dn":"Warring+States+-+Europa+Universalis+IV+mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b59e4a468ad463d8a47b73c74b69b314db74bc03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,158,74,70,138,212,99,216,164,123,115,199,75,105,179,20,219,116,188,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
