In a night of high drama, will the young couple prove they have what it takes to stay in the competition?\r\nJP and Nelly QLD\r\nBoth our families are European. \r\nFor Nelly, 25, it was love at first sight when she met her new boss JP, 30. Luckily, after leaving the job love blossomed along with a healthy appreciation of nutritional food. Now â€œtea obsessedâ€ Nelly wants to wow the MKR dining table with her tea-infused menu along with some help from her beau, who just happens to be the son of a French chef.\r\nWhat sort of cooking do you specialise in?\r\nJP: I specialise in winging it. I donâ€™t follow recipes, I sort of just open an empty fridge and I cook a meal. I love to cook Mexican and street food - anything you can eat with your hands.\r\nNelly: I love to do desserts - my thing is tea-infused desserts. Tea-infused everything. I drink a load of tea. Iâ€™m a tea enthusiast. Iâ€™m a crazy tea lady; I just need a cat.\r\nWho taught you to cook?\r\nNelly: Both our families are European so weâ€™ve been brought up with home cooking; no frozen meals, nothing from cans, everything fresh food so I think thatâ€™s how we got our love for cooking.\r\nJP: My dad was a chef so as a kid Iâ€™d always be in the kitchen helping him, even in his restaurants Iâ€™d pop in and do things with him. So I think that got me into it a bit.\r\nNelly: His dad is French so he taught me things to say to Manu. JP: I got her to say cheeky things.\r\nNelly: My dad is Italian and my mum is Polish.\r\nJP: And my mum is Polish too. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s good about us because we donâ€™t just cook one style of food; we can do everything.\r\nHow has your cooking evolved over time?\r\nJP: Nelly has improved heaps actually. Not long ago I wouldâ€™ve said she couldnâ€™t cook.\r\nNelly: Excuse me! Iâ€™ve cooked the best pastas youâ€™ve ever tried in your life.\r\nJP: She can cook a good pasta sauce. But now sheâ€™s amazing.\r\nWhatâ€™s an average dinner at home?\r\nNelly: We never do a boring dish. We try to make things that are fatty into healthy which is really cool. We do healthy Mexican. We get an idea and we just roll with it and it usually works.\r\nSo youâ€™re healthy cooks?\r\nJP: Not in the show so much because itâ€™s a cooking competition, but in our normal life yes.\r\nNelly: But we donâ€™t let that get in the way of flavour first. Butter is our key ingredient.\r\nAny big cooking disasters?\r\nNelly: We made a Polish cheesecake and it was horrible.\r\nJP: It was like an omelette on the outside and raw in the middle.\r\nAny favourite kitchen gadgets?\r\nNelly: The mixer, I love that.\r\nJP: The cleaver. I have a really big heavy cleaver at home and I love it. It was my dadâ€™s.\r\nWhatâ€™s each otherâ€™s most annoying habits?\r\nJP: This will go for a while, Iâ€™m annoying. Sheâ€™s too beautiful. But she annoys me when I drive.\r\nNelly: He is the worst driver ever. And he licks my face a lot and I hate it. He is like a teenage boy.\r\nWhy do you have what it takes to win?\r\nNelly: Weâ€™re always adapting, always keen to learn and I think that we can do so many different things. Weâ€™re not just stuck in one style of cooking.\r\nJP: I think the main thing is we work really well together. Regardless if itâ€™s cooking or other things, we work really well together.\r\nNelly: Yeah, we bounce really well off each other. Where Iâ€™m lacking he can pick it up and vice versa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8892b0c35c34790afca0d5086c22d666fff9c15","amp;dn":"My.kitchen.rules.s07e10.ws.pdtv.x264.bf1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8892b0c35c34790afca0d5086c22d666fff9c15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,137,43,12,53,195,71,144,175,202,13,80,134,194,45,102,111,255,156,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
