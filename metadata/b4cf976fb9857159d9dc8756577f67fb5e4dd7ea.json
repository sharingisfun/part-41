So, listening again to the ritornello from Vertigo, and then the score from Psycho, written for string orchestra by Bernard Herrmann: insistent, hypnotic, with its dissonances inspired by Elgar or Ives: a nonmelody immediately recognizable, time becomes sound, permeated with dread; all becomes more intense\n\n\nWhen it was formed by Dominique Lemonnier to perform the music written by Alexandre Desplat for the film Un hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ros trÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s discret (1996, dir. Jacques Audiard), the Traffic Quintet was making its debut in the film world. The Quintet took its name from that first experience in the Seventh Art ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as a tribute to Jacques Tati ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the group has since gone deeper into film music. Surrounding violinist Dominique Lemonnier are other French instrumentalists from prestigious orchestras ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Anne Villette (violin), Estelle Villotte (viola), RaphaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l Perraud (cello), Philippe Noharet (contrabass) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the avowed ambition of the string ensemble is to revisit soundtracks that have now become part of our musical heritage. Thanks to this meeting of musicians, all them open to the discovery of new music forms, the Traffic Quintet produces a sound that is dense yet malleable, both modern and classical: above all, it is a sound that is immediately recognizable. If arrangements are writing games played by composers, this brand new formation has introduced infinite freedom and variety into the rules. The Traffic QuintetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s public performances feed on productive exchanges between music and contemporary art ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially projected videos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the QuintetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s members propose a space for a walk through the film music universe which precisely echoes their desire to move freely between genres and eras. The abstract videos of Dominique Lemonnier and artist Ange Leccia, together with the space created by stage designer Bruno Cohen, contribute additional poetic licence to a project which, for the listener-spectator, might well be transformed into a total experience. The Traffic Quintet has already appeared at prestigious venues in New York, Washington, Paris (the CitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© de la Musique and the ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢tre de lÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Atelier), Kuwait City and Rome (the Villa Medicis), and in 2007 the ensemble was invited to Cannes for a performance during the Film FestivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 60th Anniversary.\n\nThe QuintetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second show, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDivine FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mininÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was premiered at StrasbourgÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Musica Festival and in Belgium at the Handelsbeurs Concertzaal in Ghent; in November 2009 it was presented in Braunschweig and Thessalonica before its French premiere in Paris (December 6th 2010) at the famous TheÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢tre des Bouffes du Nord. The Traffic Quintet recorded the following soundtracks : Fantastic Mr Fox (Wes Anderson), Army of Crime (Robert GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©diguian) and Lust Caution (Ang Lee).\n\n\nTracks \n01/ Basic Instinct (Jerry Goldsmith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢56\n02/ Vertigo (Bernard Herrmann) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢00\n03/ Psycho (Bernard Herrmann) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢58\n04/ Medeamaterial Extrait nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Âº1 (Pascal Dusapin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢44\n05/ Fahrenheit 451 (B.
