Pascale always acted as if she was the provider and head of the household, even now the inseparable brothers are twenty. But she started a secret affair with Flemish neighbor, cook Jan, whose ambition is to start a restaurant and B&amp;B with her. As the boys learn she wants to cancel her job and sell the house for the project, college-man Thierry, who has a steady girl Anne, naturally refuses to let her spend dad's money meant for them. Gentler FranÃƒÂ§ois, content to remain a handyman, would consider letting her and maybe working in the 'family business'. This causes trouble, even after Pascale moves out to Gerda's indefinitely, leading to tragedy.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:724d6870535b491e707687c5d793f1134e7bbf52","amp;dn":"Nue+Propriete+aka+Private+Property+2006+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"724d6870535b491e707687c5d793f1134e7bbf52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,77,104,112,83,91,73,30,112,118,135,197,215,147,241,19,78,123,191,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
