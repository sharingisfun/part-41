A beautiful return to her folkier roots, more in the vein of the lush &quot;Angels &amp; Electricity&quot;. Beautifully produced by Boo Hewerdine &amp; Eddi Reader, the album also features long time Eddi drummer Roy Dodds and Teddy Borowiecki (Jane Siberry, kd lang).\nThis is the Japanese release with 2 bonus tracks. I believe &quot;Good Girl&quot; was a theme song to a UK TV show?\nPlease enjoy and share\n\n\n1 Wolves04:30 \n2 Wanting Kind, The03:55 \n3 Lucky Penny\n4 Simple Soul04:17 \n5 Adam04:33 \n6 Footsteps Fall02:45 \n7 Blues Run The Game05:02 \n8 I Felt A Soul Move Through Me03:50 \n9 Prodigal Daughter03:39 \n11 Girl Who Fell In Love With The Moon, The03:19 \n10 Eden05:03 \n12The Curragh Of Kildare\n13 Good Girl\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60414f236894f45012c321f8fc826217596dde48","amp;dn":"Eddi+Reader+-+Simple+Soul+-+Japan+Bonus+Tracks+320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60414f236894f45012c321f8fc826217596dde48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,65,79,35,104,148,244,80,18,195,33,248,252,130,98,23,89,109,222,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
