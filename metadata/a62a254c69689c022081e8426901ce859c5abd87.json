The series is written by the British Andy Hamilton and the American Jay Tarses, with Tarses playing a sour shopkeeper named Samuel Oliphant and Hamilton playing a cheerfully corrupt, one-legged, one-eyed, one-armed, one-nostrilled British soldier, Sergeant Roy McGurk.\n\nThe story revolved around the imposition of martial law in Baltimore and the springing up of a torrid, though also chaste, love affair between Oliphant's daughter (a notorious anti-British pamphleteer operating under the pseudonym Spartacus) and an officer of the local British garrison, Captain Brimshaw.\n\n\nAndy Hamilton - Sergeant McGurk \nJay Tarses - Samuel Oliphant \nSophie Thompson [1] / Jan Ravens [2] / Julia Hills [3] - Mary Oliphant \nJames Fleet - Captain Brimshaw \nHugh Dennis - Ezekiel Spriggs \nFelicity Montague [1] / Penelope Nice [2] - Cora \nTony Maudsley - Joshua \nSusie Blake - Mrs. Arbuthnot \nTimothy West - King George III\n\n\nRevolting People - S01 - E01 - Storm Clouds\nRevolting People - S01 - E02 - More Storm Clouds\nRevolting People - S01 - E03 - Even More Storm Clouds\nRevolting People - S01 - E04 - Tons Of Storm Clouds\nRevolting People - S01 - E05 - A Helluva Lot Of Storm Clouds\nRevolting People - S01 - E06 - An Incredible Amount Of Storm Clouds\n\nRevolting People - S02 - E01 - Trying Times \nRevolting People - S02 - E02 - Even More Trying Times \nRevolting People - S02 - E03 - Some More Trying Times \nRevolting People - S02 - E04 - And Yet Even More Trying Times \nRevolting People - S02 - E05 - A Bunch More Trying Times \nRevolting People - S02 - E06 - Still In Trying Times \n\nRevolting People - S03 - E01 - Young Love \nRevolting People - S03 - E01 - A Kiss Is Just A Kiss \nRevolting People - S03 - E03 - The God-Given Talent \nRevolting People - S03 - E04 - Over The Rainbow \nRevolting People - S03 - E05 - Them Thar Hills \nRevolting People - S03 - E06 - Secrets And Lies \n\nRevolting People - S04 - E01 - Ezekiel Is Kidnapped\nRevolting People - S04 - E02 - McGurk Runs the Shop\nRevolting People - S04 - E03 - George Washington\nRevolting People - S04 - E04 - Pirates\nRevolting People - S04 - E05 - Reunion\nRevolting People - S04 - E06 - The King\n\nThanks to Thibor for series 04.\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 27mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n[b]\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.\n\nThere is little point in downloading a &quot;Torrent&quot; and then recreating a &quot;Torrent&quot; using the same files.\n\nThe fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,\n\nAll you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the &quot;same&quot; files and make both have less seeders.\n\n\n\n[/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62a254c69689c022081e8426901ce859c5abd87","amp;dn":"Revolting+People+-+S01+to+04+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62a254c69689c022081e8426901ce859c5abd87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,42,37,76,105,104,156,2,32,129,232,66,105,1,206,133,156,90,189,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
