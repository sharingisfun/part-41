Kershaw\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nOn the afternoon of 17 September 1944 Lieutenant Enthammer, a Wehrmacht artillery officer based in Arnhem, gazed up at the clear skies, hardly believing what he saw. White Ã¢â‚¬ËœsnowflakesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ appeared to hang in the air. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThat cannot be,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ he thought. Ã¢â‚¬ËœIt never snows in September! They must be parachutists!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ They were. He was witnessing the first wave of the British parachute assault on Arnhem. The war was approaching the Reich. The blow, moreover, had come as a complete surprise. The Allies expected Operation Market Garden, of which the assault at Arnhem was the last link in a chain that stretched far to the south, to bring the collapse of the Wehrmacht in the west and shorten the war. But the Germans, however, had other ideas and resolved to fight, bringing days of some of the most bitter fighting on the campaign after the initial onslaught in June 1944. Based on extensive research, It Never Snows in September uniquely chronicles that struggle through the eyes of the German soldier and analyses the reasons for the eventual outcome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3371b8a9b41bdf48f406f506c3349c47093f601","amp;dn":"It+Never+Snows+In+September%3A+The+German+View+Of+Market-Garden+An","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3371b8a9b41bdf48f406f506c3349c47093f601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,55,27,138,155,65,189,244,143,64,111,80,108,51,73,196,112,147,246,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
