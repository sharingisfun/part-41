A rare day with a flat finale with a lot of pressure on the teams of the sprinters to control the race and not let a breakaway steal the show. Expect a thrilling chase and a blisteringly fast finish. Presented by Gary Imlach with analysis from Chris Boardman, commentary by Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen with Ned Boulting the reporter at the roadside.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 1.49 GB\nRun-Time__: 2h 14 min\nContainer_: MKV\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC Main L3.1 832x468 50fps CRF=26 ~1500Kbps\nAudio_____: HE-AAC VBR 2ch 24/48KHz Q=0.24 ~64Kbps\n\ndb.tt/wHGqEnKq\ntwitter[dot]com/JungleBoyNX\n\nI'm off on holiday on 26th July for one week so I won't be uploading the last 2 stages (stages 20 and 21) but I'll upload them a week later on 3rd August when I get back.
