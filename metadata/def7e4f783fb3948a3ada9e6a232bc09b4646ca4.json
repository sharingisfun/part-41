And this is one of the best albums of the 90's. Unjustly labeled post-grunge, Candlebox definately have their own distinct sound.\n\nNow on to the album. The first track, Simple Lessons is rockin' and reminiscent of their debut but that's where the similarities stop. This is an album you have to listen to all the way through a couple times to appreciate it, but when you do it is definately worth it. My favorite song is Butterfly. It is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever head. That song has to have the most breathtaking chorus I've ever heard. The Reprise version is similarly great and a little more trippy. Other great rock songs include Drowned, Best Friend, and It's Amazing. Some mellower, but equally enjoyable songs include Lucy, Become (To Tell), and\nVulgar Before Me. If you like their debut because of Kevin Martin's voice, you won't be disappointed. He sounds better than ever.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Simple lessons                                       [02:52]\n02.Drowned                                              [04:51]\n03.Lucy                                                 [04:45]\n04.Best friend                                          [03:08]\n05.Become (to tell)                                     [03:36]\n06.Understanding                                        [04:57]\n07.Crooked halo                                         [04:12]\n08.Bothered                                             [02:16]\n09.Butterfly                                            [04:54]\n10.It's amazing                                         [04:00]\n11.Vulgar before me                                     [03:37]\n12.Butterfly (reprise)                                  [06:18]\n____\n\n49:26 min\n 70,4 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
