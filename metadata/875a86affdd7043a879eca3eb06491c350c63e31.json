There are those who value such classification systems, seeing each revision of the DSM as a fine-tuning exercise, and there are those who are strongly opposed, seeing such exercises as fundamentally flawed.\n\n'Madness Cracked' provides a fascinating introduction to the history of psychiatry and clinical psychology, looking at how these areas have attempted to classify the various problems and disorders that their practitioners have faced in everyday use. Within the book, Power argues that - like in other areas of science - progress can only be made if the classification systems that are used have a sound theoretical basis. In addition, he outlines a model derived from work on cognition and emotion showing how, with appropriate modifications, it could provide a theoretical basis for classification and diagnosis.\n\nUsing extraordinary examples from the history of psychiatry and clinical psychology, along with fascinating case material, he shows how our current knowledge in psychology can be developed to provide the theoretical basis that the field needs. For anyone in the field of mental health, Madness Cracked is a thought-provoking and controversial new book.'\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 243 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press; 1 edition (January 2, 2015 [Hardcover])\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0198703872\nISBN-13: 978-0198703877\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:875a86affdd7043a879eca3eb06491c350c63e31","amp;dn":"Madness+Cracked+%282015%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"875a86affdd7043a879eca3eb06491c350c63e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,90,134,175,253,215,4,58,135,158,202,62,176,100,145,195,80,198,62,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
