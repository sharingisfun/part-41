Beneath  the   ruins   of      \n          post-apocalyptic Moscow,  in  the  tunnels  of  the      \n          Metro, the remnants  of  mankind  are  besieged  by      \n          deadly threats from outside ÃƒÂ» and  within.  Mutants      \n          stalk the catacombs beneath the  desolate  surface,      \n          and hunt  amidst  the  poisoned  skies  above.  But      \n          rather than stand united, the station-cities of the      \n          Metro are locked in a  struggle  for  the  ultimate      \n          power, a doomsday device from the  military  vaults      \n          of D6. A civil war  is  stirring  that  could  wipe      \n          humanity from the face of  the  earth  forever.
