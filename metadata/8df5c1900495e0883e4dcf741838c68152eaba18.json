Released following Parker's death two years after the date, the recording finds him in remarkable form, his playing robust, pointed, and witty. And although each participant is a band leader, composer, and groundbreaking stylist on his instrument, the performance demonstrates that Parker remained first among equals. Compositionally, Jazz at Massey Hall leans heavily on the bebop book developed by Gillespie, and includes &quot;Salt Peanuts,&quot; &quot;Wee,&quot; and &quot;A Night in Tunisia.&quot; Also featured are Tadd Dameron's &quot;Hot House,&quot; the Ellington standard &quot;Perdido,&quot; and &quot;All the Things You Are.&quot; Initially released on Debut Records, a label co-owned by Mingus and Roach\n\nTracklist:\n1.
