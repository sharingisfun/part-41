The five chapters, State-Variable Analysis of Continuous-Time Systems, Analysis of Discrete-Time Systems, Stability Analysis of Non-Linear Systems, Optimal Control, and Adaptive Control have been written to emphasize concepts and provide the basic mathematical derivations. Complete coverage of standard topics, e.g., eigenvalues, eigenvectors, the z-transform, Lyapunov s Method, controllability, observability, etc. are discussed. Numerous examples and exercises have also been included in the book for self-study.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3ab719459abcf6221358a908632c9daf2106111","amp;dn":"Modern+Control+Systems%3A+An+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3ab719459abcf6221358a908632c9daf2106111","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,171,113,148,89,171,207,98,33,53,138,144,134,50,201,218,242,16,97,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
