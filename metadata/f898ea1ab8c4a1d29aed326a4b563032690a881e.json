This is literary science fiction with a feminist twist, and it explores themes of choice, agency, rebellion, and family. Ava, a teenage girl living aboard the male-dominated, conservative deep space merchant ship Parastrata, faces betrayal, banishment, and death. Taking her fate into her own hands, she flees to the Gyre, a floating continent of garbage and scrap in the Pacific Ocean. This is a sweeping and harrowing novel about a girl who can't read or write or even withstand the forces of gravity. What choices will she make? How will she build a future on an earth ravaged by climate change? Named by the American Booksellers Association as a Spring 2014 Indies Introduce Pick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f898ea1ab8c4a1d29aed326a4b563032690a881e","amp;dn":"Salvage+-+Alexandra+Duncan+%5BAdvance+Reader%27s+Edition%5D.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f898ea1ab8c4a1d29aed326a4b563032690a881e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,152,234,26,184,196,161,210,154,237,50,106,75,86,48,50,105,10,136,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
