Shot on location in Jerusalem and throughout Europe, the series explores the different ways artists have depicted the Easter story through the ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Betrayal \r\nWe begin by looking at depictions of The Last Supper including Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece; a 6th century mosaic and a modern interpretation by Chris Ofili. We then turn to interpretations of Jesus' betrayal and trial by artists including Bosch and Tintoretto. Finally, we examine portrayals of Jesus' final judgement in work by HonorÃ© Daumier and Mark Wallinger.\r\n\r\n2)  Crucifixion \r\nOur exploration begins in Varallo, northern Italy, where the Stations of the Cross were carved into a series of sculptures and frescoes by a 15th century Franciscan friar. We then look at Tintoretto's enormous depiction of the crucifixion in Venice and GrÃ¼newald's harrowing image above the Issenheim altar. We also take a modern journey to the Philippines with Sebastian Horsley who, for the sake of his art, experienced a form of crucifixion for himself.\r\n\r\n3)  Resurrection \r\nWe take a look at works by Giotto, Michelangelo and Sam Taylor-Wood depicting the mourning over Jesus' body. Next, we compare interpretations of the resurrection and ascension in several very different treatments including work by GrÃ¼newald and Rembrandt and Stanley Spencer.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Easter-in-Art-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Easter-in-Art-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Easter-in-Art-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Easter-in-Art-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Easter-in-Art-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2b/Easter-in-Art-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Easter-in-Art-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Easter-in-Art-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Easter-in-Art-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1144Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 848x480\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 30000/1001 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 71 mins (total)\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1 (3 chapters)\r\n * Part Size: 649 MB\r\n * Source: DVD\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.seventh-art.com/shop/easter-in-art-download-only/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58d97c43fca699abe905a7b9fbf83be08b43e960","amp;dn":"Exhibition+on+Screen+2003+Easter+in+Art+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58d97c43fca699abe905a7b9fbf83be08b43e960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,217,124,67,252,166,153,171,233,5,167,185,251,248,59,224,139,67,233,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
