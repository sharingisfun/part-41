New busi-nesses are springing up every day across the country, and the majority of them are \nstarted right at home. Whether these new ventures are inspired by stay-at-home \nmoms looking to earn extra cash, young people starting their careers with their \nown businesses, previously employed middlemanagers, or just regular folks look-ing to increase their monthly income, many are fi nding themselves caught in the \nentrepreneurial spirit.\nAs companies are learning to be leaner and meaner, career-minded indi-viduals are learning that the only place to fi nd true job security is right in their \nown home. Th ey already know that the best way to prevent a layoffis to open up \nshop for themselves. Changes in government programs and tax benefits for these \nentrepreneurs have created a market situation for which it has never been easier \nto startÃ¢â‚¬â€and operateÃ¢â‚¬â€a new business. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost as if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be foolish not to try \nyour hand at running your own show. \nNew technology in both the communications and computer industries has \nmade home offices the norm, instead of the exception. Many entrepreneurs have \nbeen able to start their own home ventures while still employed, thus increasing \ntheir capital and minimizing their day-to-day fi nancial risk. \nThis book, revised and updated with twenty-four new business opportuni-ties, emphasizes the potential for many businesses that might start out as hobbies, \npersonal interests, or an expansion of a particular skill you might already have. \nTake time to read through all of the business opportunities included here. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll \nfi nd that there is a balanced mix of part-time and full-time opportunities. Many \njobs listed are considered white collar, but there are plenty of businesses listed that \nrequire a more hands-on approach and specific technical skills.\nAs you read each business description, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll notice some specifi c statistical \ninformation at the beginning of each entry. It is organized as follows:\n\nStart-up costs:Start-up costs can include everything from outfitting your home \noffi ce with furniture, computer equipment, and business cards, to advertising cam-paigns and staffi ng. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve calculated these costs by adding together all potential \nviii Introduction\nequipment, advertising, and operating capital estimates (such as payroll, benefits, \nand utilities). We considered every possible cost, and then asked the question: \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the least amount of money you would need to start this business the \nright way?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nPotential earnings:For most businesses listed in this book, this range is \ncalculated by multiplying typical fees by a forty-hour work week. However, the \nmarket for some of these jobs is such that, while they would provide great extra or \npart-time income, they are not likely to provide forty hours of pay per week, year \nround. Obviously, your potential earnings will change dramatically if you are only \nconsidering starting any new business part-time. Please note: Potential earnings \ndo not take into consideration the costs incurred during startup. \nTypical fees:Each business idea has been thoroughly researched to fi nd out \nwhat people who are actually in the business are charging their clients. For many \nentries, you will see a range instead of one fl at fee, since pricing strategies often \nvary depending on geographic location.\nAdvertising:Here we have listed all the possible ways you could promote your \nbusiness, from methods that cost nothing, such as networking, to developing actual \nmedia campaigns that might cost thousands of dollars a year. These expenses have \nbeen figured into initial start-up costs.\nQualifications:This category contains everything you need to know about pro-fessional certifications, licenses, and other information pertinent to what it takes \nto work at home in a particular field.\nEquipment needed:The equipment purchases you are likely to make to run \nyour business effi ciently.\nStaffrequired:A high percentage of these businesses wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require anyone but \nyourself, but those needing additional staffare identified, often with a suggested \nnumber of employees.\nHidden costs:This is probably the most important element of each entry. Th e \ncosts that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think about are often the ones that drive your business into \nthe ground. Th ey include insurance coverage, workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ compensation, and even \nfluctuating material costs. Many of these are expenses that you simply canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t predict \nor that you might not have realized are incurred by state and federal government \nrequirements. Some may be as simple as the cost of additional gasoline.\nIntroduction  ix\nThe rest of each entry provides detailed descriptions of what the job entails and \nwhat you would need to be effective in your new venture. With each job, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get \na total picture of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involved in successfully running the kind of business that \nmatches your skills and interests.\nWhat You Do:This section supplies the details of exactly what each business \ndemands of its owner, what your daily activities would be, and who your cus-tomers would be. Th is section also includes information on specifi c marketing \nopportunities.\nWhat You Need:Here youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll fi nd an in-depth breakdown of your start-up costs, \nincluding offi ce furniture, computer equipment,and advertising costs. You will \nalso fi nd valuable information on how toarrive at specific income goals for each \nbusiness.\nKeys to Success:This section points out the positive and negative aspects of each \nbusiness, so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know exactly what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in for. Remember, there are positives \nand negatives for every opportunity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12f9e6c2e5e038599a85ba34cab71a5488bb3499","amp;dn":"The+200+Best+Home+Businesses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12f9e6c2e5e038599a85ba34cab71a5488bb3499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,249,230,194,229,224,56,89,154,133,186,52,202,183,26,84,136,187,52,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
