Some of them were ready to go, some needed tag fixing, some needed to be converted from FLAC to something humans use, and some were old LP rips from vinyl that were torrented as a single mp3 file, regardless of track. I am releasing these with this generic disclaimer at the top to save the time of having to explain each one individually. These are released AS IS, and lower bit rate albums cannot be re-torrented as higher quality as I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t HAVE the original albums. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m just doing what I can to make sure as much standup comedy as possible is out there on the public trackers and not just on private ones. Much thanks to all the original OPs, especially those folks who have ripped older LP albums that are so much harder to find than more recent stuff. Wherever possible, I have fixed tags, included album notes and artwork, and listed the album tracks. As a lover of comedy, I hope some of you younger folks take a chance on loading some of the older and perhaps unknown (to YOU!) stuff, and giving it a chance. There WAS comedy before Daniel Tosh and Tim Minchin, and some of it was freaking brilliant. Try to expand your repertoire. Enjoy.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://allmusic.com/album/jewish-american-princess-r82376&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://allmusic.com/album/jewish-american-princess-r82376&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LaceaaadL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LaceaaadL&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJewish American Princess Track Listing\n\n1 - Jewish American Princess\n2 - Care and Feeding of Judy Ann Pearlman\n3 - Her First Home Away from Home\n4 - Boy Friends\n5 - Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\n6 - Peace March\n7 - The &quot;In&quot; Places\n8 - Engaged to Be Married\n9 - Night Before the Wedding\n10 - Wedding Night\n11 - Back from the Honeymoon\n12 - Alergy Doctor\n13 - Everything You Have Always Wanted About the Jewish American Princess\n14 - Enrollment\n15 - Panic in the House\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b0dcc69380828593711831fe73a0a9cc132541","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Booker+%26+Foster+-+Jewish+American+Princess","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b0dcc69380828593711831fe73a0a9cc132541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,176,220,198,147,128,130,133,147,113,24,49,254,115,160,169,204,19,37,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
