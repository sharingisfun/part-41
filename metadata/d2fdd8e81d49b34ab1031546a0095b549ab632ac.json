Then it's about time you picked up Head First HTML with CSS &amp; XHTML and really learned HTML. You want to learn HTML so you can finally create those web pages you've always wanted, so you can communicate more effectively with friends, family, fans, and fanatic customers. You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your Web pages over time, and so your web pages work in all the browsers and mobile devices out there. Oh, and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay - we won't tell anyone you're still partying like it's 1999 - but if you're going to create Web pages in the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS. \nLearn the real secrets of creating Web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS is in an external style sheet. \nWith Head First HTML with CSS &amp; XHTML, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a font tag into your pages. Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, this book will load HTML, CSS, and XHTML into your brain in a way that sticks. \nSo what are you waiting for? Leave those other dusty books behind and come join us in Webville. Your tour is about to begin. \n&quot;Elegant design is at the core of every chapter here, each concept conveyed with equal doses of pragmatism and wit.&quot; --Ken Goldstein, Executive Vice President, Disney Online \n&quot;This book is a thoroughly modern introduction to forward-looking practices in web page markup and presentation.&quot; --Danny Goodman, author of Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide \n&quot;What used to be a long trial and error learning process has now been reduced neatly into an engaging paperback.&quot; --Mike Davidson, CEO, Newsvine, Inc. \n&quot;I love Head First HTML with CSS &amp; XHTML--it teaches you everything you need to learn in a 'fun coated' format!&quot; --Sally Applin, UI Designer and Artist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2fdd8e81d49b34ab1031546a0095b549ab632ac","amp;dn":"Head+First+HTML+with+CSS+%26+XHTML","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2fdd8e81d49b34ab1031546a0095b549ab632ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,253,216,232,29,73,179,74,177,3,21,70,160,9,91,84,154,182,50,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
