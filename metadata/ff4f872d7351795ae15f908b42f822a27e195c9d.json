Now with a new foreword exclusive to the ebook edition, in which Louis Zamperini reflects on his life through 2010 and being the subject of HillenbrandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s critically acclaimed biography.\n\nA juvenile delinquent, a world class NCAA miler, a 1936 Olympian, a WWII bombardier: Louis Zamperini had a fuller than most, when it changed in an instant. On May 27, 1943, his BÃ¢â‚¬â€œ24 crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Louis and two other survivors found a raft amid the flaming wreckage and waited for rescue. Instead, they drifted two thousand miles for fortyÃ¢â‚¬â€œseven days. Their only food: two shark livers and three raw albatross. Their only water: sporadic rainfall. Their only companions: hope and faithÃ¢â‚¬â€œand the everÃ¢â‚¬â€œpresent sharks. On the fortyÃ¢â‚¬â€œseventh day, mere skeletons close to death, Zamperini and pilot Russell Phillips spotted landÃ¢â‚¬â€œand were captured by the Japanese. Thus began more than two years of torture and humiliation as a prisoner of war.\n\nZamperini was threatened with beheading, subject to medical experiments, routinely beaten, hidden in a secret interrogation facility, starved and forced into slave labour, and was the constant victim of a brutal prison guard nicknamed the BirdÃ¢â‚¬â€œa man so vicious that the other guards feared him and called him a psychopath. Meanwhile, the Army Air Corps declared Zamperini dead and President Roosevelt sends official condolences to his family, who never gave up hope that he was alive.\n\nSomehow, Zamperini survived and he returned home a hero. The celebration was shortÃ¢â‚¬â€œlived. He plunged into drinking and brawling and the depths of rage and despair. Nightly, the Bird's face leered at him in his dreams. It would take years, but with the love of his wife and the power of faith, he was able to stop the nightmares and the drinking.\n\nA stirring memoir from one of the greatest of the &quot;Greatest Generation,&quot; Devil at My Heels is a living document about the brutality of war, the tenacity of the human spirit, and the power of forgiveness.\n\n--\n\nISBN: 9780061972768\nISBN 10: 0061972762\nPages: 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff4f872d7351795ae15f908b42f822a27e195c9d","amp;dn":"Devil+at+My+Heels%2C+by+Louis+Zamperini+%26amp%3B+Dnsin+%5BePub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff4f872d7351795ae15f908b42f822a27e195c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,79,135,45,115,81,121,90,225,95,144,139,66,248,34,162,126,25,92,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
