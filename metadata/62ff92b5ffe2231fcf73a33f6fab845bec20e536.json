This Welsh comedy is set in a small town that has seen better days, and the much-loved cinema has had to shut down. It was a dank, humid sort of place, but people liked it anyway.\n\n[Spoiler] This dank, humid place gets a new lease on life when the caretakers start growing mushrooms - the legal sort - and things get more complicated...\n\nIn Welsh with English subtitles. People lined up for Hedd Wyn, so there may be an audience for this!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62ff92b5ffe2231fcf73a33f6fab845bec20e536","amp;dn":"Rhosyn+a+Rhith+%281987%29+Coming+Up+Roses+-+Cymraeg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62ff92b5ffe2231fcf73a33f6fab845bec20e536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,255,146,181,255,226,35,31,207,115,163,63,111,171,132,91,236,32,229,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
