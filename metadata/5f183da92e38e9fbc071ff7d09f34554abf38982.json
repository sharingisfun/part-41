But the band may be in line to challenge many of those quick and ripping pickers when it comes to songwriting.\n\nThe Denver-based group formed in 2008 through a network of friends at backyard and sometimes backwoods parties, and part of Trout SteakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charm is that jam-session-like looseness. But amidst that casual approach is some intensely focused attention to song structure and lyrics, backed by some very solid, yet not flamboyant, picking.
