He&amp;#039;s a family man with a loving wife, a rebellious daughter, twin sons, and a half-dead dog, he&amp;#039;s also got a nice job with the city in New Jersey. He&amp;#039;s a mass transit engineer. But one day Arlo is fired so he must try to get another job. He finds a similar one to his old one, except it&amp;#039;s in Boise, Idaho. Sounds good to Arlo, so he can finally get away from his insane neighbor who has a lawn mower the size of Pennsylvania. Only problem, how to break it to the family? The decision is soon made: they&amp;#039;re moving. Now they&amp;#039;ve got to sell their house which has hilarious results, so now they need to get movers. Two former cons now movers show up with King Kong Bundy. Now, they gotta find a new house in Idaho. They soon find their dream house, so they return to New Jersey and head off to Boise. Arlo hires a man (Dana Carvey) to drive his SAAB to Idaho, not knowing he&amp;#039;s a man of eight personalities. And if that isn&amp;#039;t bad enough, their new house is not what they expected, and their neighbor in New Jeresey&amp;#039;s twin brother lives next door and he&amp;#039;s got a gigantic mower also. And as if things couldn&amp;#039;t get any worse, they do. Arlo loses his new job and the movers never showed up. So now it&amp;#039;s time for Arlo to kick some serious A$$!\n\nStarring: Richard Prior, Beverley Todd, Stacey Dash, Randy Quaid...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee4fb962201aeabfe8712df9d4f54e6ccfbcf0c9","amp;dn":"Moving+%281988%29+XVID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee4fb962201aeabfe8712df9d4f54e6ccfbcf0c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,79,185,98,32,26,234,191,232,113,45,249,212,245,78,108,207,188,240,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
