His recording debut is marked by Requiem, an otherworldly album-length composition scored for six voices, baroque viola, harp, troubadour harp, recorders, and electric organ, containing vastly eclectic influences. While the pieceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title and instrumentation suggest a characteristically baroque structure, these indices are juxtaposed with Feldmanesque harmony, Reichian repetition, and motet-like vocal stylings, liberating the piece from a particular musical era. The music is wedded to an array of time- and place-exclusive languages, including Latin, Middle French, and Breton, allowing for further multi-referentiality and conceptual intricacy.\n\nThe piece premiered in in June 2010 as an opera an opera/dance collaboration with choreographer for Christopher Williams for his dance production HenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Teeth. The performance enhanced the collage-esque sonic references with the disparate imagery of 19th century Breton fairy tales, Greek mythology, and middle age relics. The interdisciplinary realization was called Ã¢â‚¬Å“splendidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“the jangling together of singing voices, violin, harp, recorder, chimes, and electric organ is magical, like feathers stroking the back of your neckÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Village Voice). The New York Times called SpearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ score Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most distinguished component of the evening,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the instrumentation evoking a Ã¢â‚¬Å“shimmering medieval aura,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and New Yorker critic Alex Ross described it as Ã¢â‚¬Å“cooly entrancing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe album will be released November 15th, followed by a performance at Galapagos Art Space on November 21st, alongside a piece by composer John Supko performed by the dynamic duo Due East.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newamsterdamrecords.com/?portfolio=greg-spears-requiem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newamsterdamrecords.com/?portfolio=greg-spears-requiem&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is my first torrent.
