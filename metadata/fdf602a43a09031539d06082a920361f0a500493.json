The early Cotes and Cols are on small roads and the fight to get in a breakaway will be hectic. Mont Revard is a big old climb that starts steep but levels out and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followed by a fast descent. But the section of lumpy roads that follows is probably enough to ensure long range efforts can be reeled in. These lead to Quintal where the final climb of the Tour begins. The Semnoz is described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the lung of AnnecyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as if the Alpine town needed fresh air Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more likely to leave riders breathless. The road starts climbing before the village of Quintal but the gradient gets serious after the village. A tough final climb, the plan is to have a final GC showdown on this climb. Too much to hope for? Probably but the roads are hard enough to force a selection.\n\n(profile pic and description from inrng.com/tour/#Stage20)\n\n\nEurosport (parts 1-8): live stream supposed to be 2500kbps but poor quality, dropping as low as 400kbps at times, transcoded by ffmpeg/x264 with settings -c:v libx264 -crf 26 -preset veryfast -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 64000 -ac 2.\n\nITV4 (parts 9-17): SD broadcast, encapsulated 16:9, 576i, 25fps at ~2500kbps transcoded by ffmpeg/x264 to 576p with settings -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset veryfast -vf &quot;yadif=0:-1:0&quot; -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 64000 -ac 2.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdf602a43a09031539d06082a920361f0a500493","amp;dn":"Tour+de+France+2013+stage+20+-+Annecy+to+Annecy-Semnoz+125km","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdf602a43a09031539d06082a920361f0a500493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,246,2,164,58,9,3,21,57,208,96,130,169,32,54,31,10,80,4,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
