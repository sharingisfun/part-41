He is generally regarded as the pre-eminent cellist of the first half of the 20th century, and arguably of all time. He made many recordings throughout his career, of solo, chamber, and orchestral music, also as conductor, but he is perhaps best remembered for the recordings of the Bach Cello Suites he made from 1936 to 1939.\n\nThese are the recordings Casals made of the famed Bach cello suites from 1936-1939. I noticed that here on the Bay there were recordings by several other cellists, but none from Casals. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45bc5b2c8d69cebc4dc21331f86262fc1a56d277","amp;dn":"Cello+Suites+-+Pablo+Casals+-+flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45bc5b2c8d69cebc4dc21331f86262fc1a56d277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,188,91,44,141,105,206,188,77,194,19,49,248,98,98,252,26,86,210,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
