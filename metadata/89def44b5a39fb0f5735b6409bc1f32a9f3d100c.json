She is a former managing director of Goldman Sachs and a Bears Stearns analyst. On December 1, she wrote forabout the Federal Reserve's continuation of bailout economics and protecting US mega-banks from losses incurred by European banks through derivatives. Prins is the author of It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street. \n\nAlex also talks about economic issues with regular Friday guest Bob Chapman, publisher of the International Forecaster. \n\n\nI am including in this torrent the most recent issue of Chapman's The International Forecaster [via rdubya at ConCen].\n\nNomi Prins is a terrific writer. Please enjoy these two recent articles by her.\n\nAs the World Crumbles: the ECB spins, FED smirks, and US Banks Pillage\n\nThe FedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s European &quot;Rescue&quot;: Another back-door US Bank / Goldman bailout?\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
