It was along this route that logo first preached ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s message to the pagan populace and it was along this self-same way that his body made its last journey to Libredon that would, in time, come to be known and loved all over the world as Santiago de Compostela.\n\nScanned PDF + OCR Layer\nISBN: 9781844095926\nPages: 215","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c451b86995acb14850f2fe91296970a568b8de6b","amp;dn":"A+Pilgrim%27s+Guide+to+the+Camino+Portugues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c451b86995acb14850f2fe91296970a568b8de6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,81,184,105,149,172,177,72,80,242,254,145,41,105,112,165,104,184,222,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
