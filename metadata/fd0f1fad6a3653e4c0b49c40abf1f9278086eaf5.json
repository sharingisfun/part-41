Golgo 13 is described as a mystery man of undetermined origin, possibility being at least part Japanese, who takes any assignment for any employer (it has been said he has worked for the CIA and the KGB) as long as the right price is given and will always fulfill his contracts, even if he has two or more opposing contracts at the same time. He is an uncanny sharpshooter, with near 100% accuracy and capable of lethal trick shooting, and regularly uses a customized, scoped M-16 rifle in his assassinations. He also is a heavy smoker \nof cigars. \n\nRead more at http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=4039#5ykso0JhYuXhYOER.99\n\nNote:  Error in name episode 48 - \n[Doutei]Golgo 13 - 48[DVD][256EE48].mkv\nCRC must be 2565EE48 miss one digit - &quot;5&quot;\n\n\nFansubs:\nBSS - 01-15\nSDX-RSS - 16\nBBS - 17\nFucmnack - 18-26\nDoutei - 27-50\n\nMore Info And Screens: \n\nDoutei: http://i.imgur.com/15uzmSq.jpg\n\nFucmnack: http://i.imgur.com/5HM3ym4.jpg\n\nSDX-RSS: &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/IZ9tQRs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/IZ9tQRs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBSS: &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/VRlF67B.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/VRlF67B.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd0f1fad6a3653e4c0b49c40abf1f9278086eaf5","amp;dn":"Golgo+13+%5B1-50%5D+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd0f1fad6a3653e4c0b49c40abf1f9278086eaf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,15,31,173,106,54,83,228,192,180,156,64,171,241,249,39,128,134,234,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
