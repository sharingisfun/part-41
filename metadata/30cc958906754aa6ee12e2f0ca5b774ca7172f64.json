Using a fast-paced style, it starts by introducing each of the Swing components and continues with production-quality code examples in which Swing features are customized, combined, and vigorously exercised to demonstrate real-world usage.With over 400 pages of revised text, additional examples, and new material to bring the book up to date with J2SE 1.4, Swing 2nd edition includes complete coverage of the new JSpinner and JFormattedTextField components, the new Focus and Keyboard architectures, and many other new and enhanced Swing features. Three new chapters have also been added to cover the construction of HTML and XML editor applications, and how to work with the new Drag &amp; Drop architecture.\n\nWritten for the experienced Java developer, Swingprovides an in-depth guide to getting the most out of SunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Swing/JFC user interface classes. Mixing real-world code examples and expert advice on advanced features, this book shows how to make use of this powerful library effectively within your own projects.\n\nThe best thing about this text has to be its sample programs, many of which incorporate other Java APIs to do Ã¢â‚¬Å“realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ work. For example, a demo of the scroll pane Swing component uses other JFC classes to display JPG images. For working with lists, the authors show how to process .ZIP files in Java. For demonstrating table programming, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coverage of JDBC to connect to databases. Other standout code samples include a working FTP client and a fully functional .RTF word processor. (Many of these examples are enhanced in separate steps, showing off new Swing classes and features along the way.) The authors do a particularly good job of annotating code with clear explanations referenced with numbered bullets that point out important lines of code.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30cc958906754aa6ee12e2f0ca5b774ca7172f64","amp;dn":"Swing+2nd+Edition+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30cc958906754aa6ee12e2f0ca5b774ca7172f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,204,149,137,6,117,74,166,238,18,226,240,202,91,119,76,167,23,47,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
