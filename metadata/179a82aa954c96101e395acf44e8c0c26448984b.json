This study is the first, however, to examine the motivating forces behind startling developments in David's work, such as shifting devotional practices, changing art markets, the accommodation of foreign clients, and the evolving secular nature of paintings demanded by the newly wealthy middle class in the early years of the sixteenth century. David is reconsidered here as a savvy entrepreneur with a new self-awareness as an artist, beyond the station of a simple craftsman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:179a82aa954c96101e395acf44e8c0c26448984b","amp;dn":"Gerard+David+-+Purity+of+Vision+in+an+Age+of+Transition+%28Art+Ebo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"179a82aa954c96101e395acf44e8c0c26448984b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,154,130,170,149,76,150,16,30,57,90,207,68,232,192,194,100,72,152,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
