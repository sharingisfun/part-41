Or are there aliens somewhere in space? New evidence suggests not only might other life-forms be out there, they may even be living on the planet right next door to us - Mars.\n\n\n\nRecent discoveries have shown that Mars has all the ingredients for life, including water. Now the Mars Odyssey probe, launched in April 2001, has detected huge frozen areas of permafrost, just like that found in the Antarctic on Earth.\n\n\n\nAccording to astronomers, the position of this frozen slush could hold the key to Mars&amp;#039; mysterious water cycle. And the surface ice may hide something even more exciting below.\n\nFurther information or transcript from when Horizon last looked for life on Mars in 2001.\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: Divx 5.21\nVideo Bitrate: 1811 kb/s\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 4:3\nAudio Codec: LAME MP3\nAudio BitRate: 192 kb/s\nAudio Channels: 2\nRunTime Per Part: 48m 38s\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 700mb\nRipped by jvt40","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e14701912c4faeac63137cb01cbadbda3bdd55","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+Life.On.Mars.Update.DivX521.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e14701912c4faeac63137cb01cbadbda3bdd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,225,71,1,145,44,79,174,172,99,19,124,176,28,186,219,218,59,221,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
