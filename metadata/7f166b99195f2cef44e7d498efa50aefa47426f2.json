Since that time, Jackie has grown to the position of a mafia boss and got into a full-scale war between gangsters - so his &quot;dark&quot; abilities will be very helpful. A cult called &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;, decides to capture her. Jackie confronts them. The main character will also fall into another reality, which is a psychiatric hospital (in which all the characters in the game are either employees of the hospital or by the patients themselves), giving a hint that maybe Jackie paranoid schizophrenic, but the hero who freed mignon breaks the stereotype.\nFeatures:\n&quot; Boundless strength - better and use the power of darkness for an even more dynamic gameplay. \n&quot; Unforgettable experience - feel zahvatavyvaschy scenario of Darkness, written by Paul Jenkins, to whom we owe such projects as The Incredible Hulk, Wolverine, and the original Darkness game. \n&quot; An amazing graphical style - Shadows in the colorful style of illustrating comics and color combined with the dramatic lighting in the film noir style, enliven the pages of comic books.\nRelease Information:\n&quot; Steam Application ID: 67370 \n&quot; The signature of the purchase: The Darkness II Limited Edition Retail Russia (Retail) \n&quot; System Protection: Steamworks + CEG + Custom \n&quot; Game Version: 1.1\n&quot; Limited Edition includes:\n&quot; DLC &quot;Crazy Abdul&quot; (costume for the devil) \n&quot; DLC &quot;Nourishing the heart&quot; (increase of benefits from eating the hearts) \n&quot; DLC &quot;Treasure Hunter&quot; (shows the location of bonuses) \n, &quot; original illustrations by Marc Silvestri\n&quot; Content uploaded 29 July 2013, and is identical to the licensed version of the game distributed in Steam. \n&quot; No need for third-party installers and updates.
