It was produced by Wall to Wall for BBC One. Originally shown in 1999, it was later adapted into a stage musical which appeared at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre in 2005.\n\nSynopsis -\n\nIt's 1965. Times are changing! But the swinging sixties haven't quite hit the Brookes household. Non-identical twin sisters Ellie and Arden Brookes seem destined to play out their lives behind a chip shop counter in a dreary Manchester backwater. Torn between the old narrow life of their childhood and the thrilling &quot;anything goes&quot; atmosphere of sixties rock and roll, the sisters find themselves faced with a heady mixture of new opportunities, optimism and romance. Their journey towards liberation is set against an exhilarating soundtrack of sixties music to echo the spirit of the era.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d044f22c33bf4fd6f0141956dd8f6b5a8cd21cba","amp;dn":"John+Woods+-+Sex%2C+Chips+%26+Rock+n%5C%27+Roll+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d044f22c33bf4fd6f0141956dd8f6b5a8cd21cba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,68,242,44,51,191,79,214,240,20,25,86,221,143,107,90,140,210,28,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
