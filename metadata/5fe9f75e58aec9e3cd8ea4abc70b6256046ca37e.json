Java 2D Graphics describes the 2D API from top to bottom, demonstrating how to set line styles and pattern fills as well as more advanced techniques of image processing and font handling. You'll see how to create and manipulate the three types of graphics objects: shapes, text, and images. Other topics include image data storage, color management, font glyphs, and printing. Java 2D Graphics assumes no prior knowledge of graphics. Chock full of detailed explanations and examples, this book provides beginning Java programmers with a solid foundation in 2D graphics and helps more advanced programmers create and use high-quality images in their applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe9f75e58aec9e3cd8ea4abc70b6256046ca37e","amp;dn":"Java+2D+Graphics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe9f75e58aec9e3cd8ea4abc70b6256046ca37e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,233,247,94,88,174,201,227,205,142,164,171,199,11,98,86,4,108,163,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
