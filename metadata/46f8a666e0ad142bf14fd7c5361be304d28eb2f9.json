Now, a Smurf sets foot on another planetÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Or does he? Could it possibly be a smurfspiracy to fool Dreamy Smurf into becoming the Astrosmurf? Or has Dreamy Smurf gone where no Smurf has gone before? We're not telling, and neither are the little green men known as the Swoofs! No matter what, &quot;The Astrosmurf&quot; is out of this world! Also: Gargamel returns to sink &quot;The Smurf Submarine&quot;!\n\nThe Smurfs Vol. 8 The Smurf Apprentice\nA smurf wants to emulate Papa Smurf, and decides the best way to do so would be to practice magic. So, the smurf sneaks into Gargamel's lab and steals instructions for a magic potion. The smurf foolishly drinks the potion and is turned into a monstrous lizard that all of the smurfs fear. Can Papa Smurf create an antidote? Or will the Smurfs be seeing green for the rest of their lives? Also featuring the stories &quot;Smurftraps&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot;.\n\nThe Smurfs Vol. 9 Gargamel and the Smurfs\nFour Smurftastic stories all featuring the arch-enemy of the Smurfs, Gargamel! In &quot;The Smurfnapper&quot;, which is also the first appearance of Gargamel, a Smurf is kidnapped by the evil wizard, who wants to use him as an ingredient in a potion. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Papa Smurf and the rest of the smurfs to break into his lab and save their friend without ending up as a treat for GargamelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cat Azrael. Also featuring &quot;The Smurf Not Like the Others&quot; and &quot;The Smurfs and the Little Ghost&quot;.\n\nThe Smurfs Vol. 10 The Return of the Smurfette\nVirtually all of the Smurfs are smitten with the Smurfette, which causes their zany methods of trying to win her affections to keep growing in outrageousness. From building statues to baking cakes and even dressing up like the Smurfette in order to better understand her, the Smurfs are in a frenzy competing for the love of the Smurfette. Will this madness ever die down?\n\nThe Smurfs Vol. 11 The Smurf Olympics\nHefty Smurf loves to play sports, but he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the other Smurfs to play with him. His solution: create the &quot;Smurf Olympics&quot;! The Smurfs divide themselves into two teams, all competing for the grand prize: a kiss from the Smurfette. But when one Smurf is turned down by both teams, he decides to compete on his own, throwing the entire games into chaos. Can one Smurf take on the entire Smurf Village? And can the two Smurf teams stop cheating long enough for the games to take place?\n\nThe Smurfs Vol. 12 Smurf versus Smurf\nThe Smurfs always seem to get into trouble when Papa Smurf is not around. While Papa Smurf works in his laboratory, two Smurfs begin arguing about the proper use of the word &quot;smurf&quot;. Smurfs that live in the northern part of the village use it as a verb (as in &quot;bottle smurfer&quot;), while the southerners use it as a noun (as in &quot;smurf opener&quot;). Without Papa Smurf around to calm things down, the argument quickly escalates until the northern and southern smurfs divide themselves along the village lines! With the southern Smurfs set to perform their play &quot;Little Smurf Riding Hood&quot; for the northern Smurfs, it looks like the language disagreement is going to get worse before it gets better!\n\nThe Smurfs Vol. 13 Smurf Soup\nWhen Gargamel meets a giant with an insatiable appetite, he comes up with a plan to use the giant to destroy the Smurfs: tell him that Smurfs make the most delicious soup in the world! Papa Smurf catches wind of the plot, and begins to create a potion that will enable them to turn the giant, nicknamed &quot;Bigmouth&quot;, against Gargamel. But when Bigmouth stumbles into the Smurfs village, the potion isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done yet, and the Smurfs must distract the hungry giant while Papa Smurf finishes his potion, or meet an untimely end inside this clumsy giantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belly.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7752422/The_Smurfs_Vol_1_-_The_Purple_Smurfs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7752422/The_Smurfs_Vol_1_-_The_Purple_Smurfs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7752430/The_Smurfs_Vol_2_-_The_Smurfs_and_the_Magic_Flute&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7752430/The_Smurfs_Vol_2_-_The_Smurfs_and_the_Magic_Flute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7752436/The_Smurfs_Vol_3_-_The_Smurf_King&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7752436/The_Smurfs_Vol_3_-_The_Smurf_King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7759642/The_Smurfs_Vol_4-6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7759642/The_Smurfs_Vol_4-6&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f8a666e0ad142bf14fd7c5361be304d28eb2f9","amp;dn":"The+Smurfs+Vol.+7-13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f8a666e0ad142bf14fd7c5361be304d28eb2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,248,166,102,224,173,20,43,241,79,215,197,54,27,227,4,210,142,178,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
