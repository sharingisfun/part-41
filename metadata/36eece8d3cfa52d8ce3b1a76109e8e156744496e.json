While starting from the basics, every chapter is up-to-date with the most recent developments in the field, introducing both longstanding theories and cutting-edge advances. As well as discussing the latest issues in ontology, Effingham also helpfully deals in-depth with different methodological principles (including theory choice, Quinean ontological commitment and Meinongianism) and introduces them alongside an example ontological theory that puts them into practice.\n\nThis accessible and comprehensive introduction will be essential reading for upper-level undergraduate and post-graduate students, as well as any reader interested in the present state of the subject.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 197 pages\nPublisher: Polity; 1 edition (May 28, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0745652557\nISBN-13: 978-0745652559\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36eece8d3cfa52d8ce3b1a76109e8e156744496e","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Ontology+%282013%29+by+Nikk+Effingham+%5BHxH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36eece8d3cfa52d8ce3b1a76109e8e156744496e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,238,206,141,60,250,82,216,206,59,26,118,16,158,142,21,103,68,73,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
