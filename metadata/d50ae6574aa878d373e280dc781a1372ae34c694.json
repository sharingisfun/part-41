From early on, the team was plagued with power struggles. Lex Luthor, the Wizard, Gorilla Grodd and Funky Flashman all sought to control the powerful team; Manhunter (the team's first leader) and Captain Comet, on the other hand, sought to divert the villains' evil ways into a more positive channel. After discovering the true identity of their benefactor, the team rebelled against the alien overlord. To quash their uprising, Darkseid sent Mantis and Kalibak. At the end of the struggle, Manhunter sacrificed himself to seemingly kill Darkseid. After this, the team splintered, with Luthor, the Wizard, Gorilla Grodd and Flashman leading the team at different times. However, the Wizard proved to be the most tenacious and created the definitive incarnation of the SSoSV. They went on to fight the original Crime Syndicate of America of Earth-3 and the Justice Society of America. While traveling dimensions, back on Earth-1 Silver Ghost, Mirror Master and Copperhead formed yet another team and fought the Freedom Fighters.\n\nThe Wizard's group eventually returned from Earth-2 and battled against the Justice League of America aboard their satellite headquarters. At one point in the battle, the two teams swapped bodies, allowing the super villains to discover the true identities of their nemeses. After gaining the upper hand, the Justice League wiped the memories of the super villains, precipitating Identity Crisis and the formation of the Society years later.\n\nAlso notable in this series is the first appearance of Captain Comet in over 20 years as well as the introduction of a new Star Sapphire. Both were regular, recurring characters.\n\n------\n\nI have included the original 15-issue run of SSoSV, the 16th and 17th issues (which were unreleased and unpublished due to the DC Implosion -- until Cancelled Comics Cavalcade #2), CCC #2 itself, the 1979 JLA appearances, and a few other related comics.\n\nALL CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL SCANNERS -- whoever scanned CCC #2 must have been dedicated, crazy, or both.\n\nThis fills a request by malger!\n\nPlease enjoy and don't forget to seed for our friends on TPB!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d50ae6574aa878d373e280dc781a1372ae34c694","amp;dn":"SECRET+SOCIETY+OF+SUPER-VILLAINS+01-17+%281976-1978%29+REQUESTED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d50ae6574aa878d373e280dc781a1372ae34c694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,10,230,87,74,168,120,211,115,226,128,220,120,26,19,114,174,52,198,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
