John T. Carney,Benjamin F. Schemmer \n\nBook Description\nRelease Date: September 30, 2003 \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“John Carney is one of the few heroes I have.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œLT. COL. L. H. Ã¢â‚¬Å“BUCKYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ BURRUSS, USA (Ret.)\n Founding member and Deputy Commander of Delta Force\n\nWhen the U.S. Air Force decided to create an elite Ã¢â‚¬Å“special tacticsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ team in the late 1970s to work in conjunction with special-operations forces combating terrorists and hijackers and defusing explosive international emergencies, John T. Carney was the man they turned to. Since then Carney and the U.S. Air Force Special Tactical units have circled the world on sensitive clandestine missions. They have operated behind enemy lines gathering vital intelligence. They have combated terrorists and overthrown dangerous dictators. They have suffered many times the casualty rate of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conventional forces. But they have gotten the job doneÃ¢â‚¬â€œmost recently in stunning victories in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, which Carney calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first special-operations war.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Now, for the first time, Colonel Carney lifts the veil of secrecy and reveals what really goes on inside the special-operations forces that are at the forefront of contemporary warfare.\n\nPart memoir, part military history, No Room for Error reveals how Carney, after a decade of military service, was handpicked to organize a small, under-funded, classified ad hoc unit known as Brand X, which even his boss knew very little about. Here Carney recounts the challenging missions: the secret reconnaissance in the desert of north-central Iran during the hostage crisis; the simple rescue operation in Grenada that turned into a prolonged bloody struggle. With Operation Just Cause in Panama, the Special Tactical units scored a major success, as they took down the corrupt regime of General Noriega with lightning speed. Desert Storm was another triumph, with CarneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team carrying out vital search-and-rescue missions as well as helping to hunt down mobile Scud missiles deep inside Iraq.\n\nNow with the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, special operations have come into their own, and Carney includes a chapter detailing exactly how the Air Force Special Tactics d.c. units have spearheaded the successful campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. \n\nGripping in its battle scenes, eye-opening in its revelations, No Room for Error is the first insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account of how special operations are changing the way modern wars are fought. Col. John T. Carney is an airman America can be proud of, and he has written an absolutely superb book.\n\nAmazon.com link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/No-Room-Error-Special-Tactics/dp/0345453352/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355246457&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=No+Room+for+Error%3A+The+Story+Behind+the+USAF+Special+Tactics+Unit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/No-Room-Error-Special-Tactics/dp/0345453352/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355246457&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=No+Room+for+Error%3A+The+Story+Behind+the+USAF+Special+Tactics+Unit&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5714c0094e46c0a8359da4863a3a4bef361102","amp;dn":"No+Room+for+Error%3A+The+Story+Behind+the+USAF+Special+Tactics+Uni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5714c0094e46c0a8359da4863a3a4bef361102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,87,20,192,9,78,70,192,168,53,157,164,134,58,58,75,239,54,17,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
