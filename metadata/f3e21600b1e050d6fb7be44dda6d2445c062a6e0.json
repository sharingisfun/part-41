As of December 2010, Osbourne has sold over 100 million albums worldwide.\n\nOsbourne rose to prominence as lead vocalist of the pioneering English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, a band whose radically different, intentionally dark, doom sound spawned the heavy metal genre. In his subsequent solo career Osbourne achieved a multi-platinum status in addition to the one he had earned with Black Sabbath. These things are what led Osbourne to become known as the &quot;Godfather of Heavy Metal&quot;. It was during his Sabbath days that, due to their dark style of music, Osbourne became known as the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;. Osbourne has over 15 tattoos, the most famous of which are the letters O-Z-Z-Y across the knuckles of his left hand. This was his first tattoo, created by himself as a teenager with a sewing needle and pencil lead.\n\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Osbourne's career expanded to a new medium when he became a star in his own reality show, The Osbournes, alongside wife/manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack.\n\nIn 1980, under the management of then girlfriend and later wife, Sharon Arden, the Ozzy Osbourne Band formed again as The Blizzard of Ozz. The first line-up of the band featured drummer Lee Kerslake (of Uriah Heep), bassist/lyricist Bob Daisley (of Rainbow and later Uriah Heep), keyboardist Don Airey, and guitarist Randy Rhoads (of Quiet Riot). The record company would eventually title the record Blizzard of Ozz credited simply under Osbourne's name. Co-written with Daisley and Rhoads, the album brought Osbourne considerable success on his first solo effort. The debut sold very well with hard rock/heavy metal fans.\nOsbourne performing in Cardiff, 1981.\n\n\n\nDiary of a Madman is the second studio album by Ozzy Osbourne. It was recorded from the 9th of Feb to the 23 of March 1981 inclusively - the end of winter in the UK and recording ending just into spring equinox. It was released on November 7, 1981, and re-issued on August 22, 1995. An altered version appeared in 2002. This was the last album with Randy Rhoads before his death in 1982. Although bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Tommy Aldridge are credited in the liner notes and pictured on the inner sleeve, it was bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake who performed all bass and drum parts on the original release. They were not given credit for their contributions. According to a 2005 interview with Daisley, even though Don Airey is credited for having played keyboards on this record, it was in fact a musician named Johnny Cook (who had worked with Bob Daisley in Mungo Jerry) who recorded the keyboard parts, as Airey was on tour with Rainbow. The album features several songs with acoustic/classical guitar intros, including &quot;You Can't Kill Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;S.A.T.O.&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot;, and the title track. The album is Osbourne's personal favorite of all his releases. To date, the album has sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide.\n\nDiary of a Madman was re-released in 2002 with the original bass and drum tracks, recorded by Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake, respectively, removed and replaced by new recordings by Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin.\n\nIn 2010 Sony announced new re-releases of Diary of a Madman and Blizzard of Ozz, featuring Randy Rhoads, with the original bass and drum tracks restored. These will be Deluxe 30th Anniversary Editions with demos, rarities and previously unreleased live material. The release date had been delayed, but was later announced to be 31 May 2011. Two versions of the album will be released: a two-disc 'Legacy Edition' containing the original album on disc 1 and a live concert featuring Osbourne and Rhoads on disc 2, and a single disc remastered version containing only the 8 tracks from the original release. A box set featuring both re-issued albums, the Blizzard of Ozz/Diary of a Madman 30th Anniversary Deluxe Box Set, will also be released, featuring both CD re-issues, 180-gram LP Vinyl versions of both albums (original album only), the &quot;Thirty Years After The Blizzard&quot; DVD Documentary, over 70 minutes of additional rare live performances and interviews, a replica of Ozzy's iconic cross, and a 2 sided poster.\n\nPersonnel:\n\n   Ozzy Osbourne Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead &amp; backing vocals, production\n   Randy Rhoads Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, production\n   Bob Daisley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n   Lee Kerslake Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\n\nAdditional Personnel:\n\n   Johnny Cook Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards (uncredited)\n   Louis Clark Ã¢â‚¬â€œ string arrangements on &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;\n   Robert Trujillo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass on 2002 reissue\n   Mike Bordin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums on 2002 reissue\n   Rudy Sarzo - bass on 2011 reissue live disc\n   Tommy Aldridge - drums on 2011 reissue live disc\n\n\nFull-lenght re-released in 2011.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDISC 1: Diary of a Madman\n\n1.
