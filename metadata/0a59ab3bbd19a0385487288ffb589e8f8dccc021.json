Comprising twelve tracks, plus one bonus track in the guise of a traditional Estonian folk song, _Vere Kutse Kohustab_ displays noticeable musical evolution over Loits&amp;#039; first full-length; less warlike, more varied and more finely honed, the material featured on this release focuses essentially on mid-paced 4/4 tempos comprising a typical &quot;nationalistic rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; roll&quot; tinge somehow reminiscent of that found on Absurd&amp;#039;s latest recording, _Blutgericht_ (ÃƒÆ’  propos of which, a mere glance at _Vere Kutse Kohustab_&amp;#039;s splendid packaging will leave no doubt regarding Loits&amp;#039; political agenda).\n\nMeshing direct, simplistic and efficient guitar riffs and a rasping vocal delivery similar to those found on latter-day Moonfog material, with traditional tones and discreet, tastefully interspersed keyboard and accordion lines, _Vere Kutse Kohustab_ is not what one could call a spectacular or boisterous release, but rather an atmospheric, inspiring and memorable collection of sombre, patriotic anthems that unfailingly hit their mark. Lembetu&amp;#039;s clear vocals are chanted boldly, adding a proud, heathen atmosphere to Loits&amp;#039; powerful songwriting. This Estonian act is undoubtedly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and I can only hope that this second release will give Loits the momentum required to be acknowledged by the international scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a59ab3bbd19a0385487288ffb589e8f8dccc021","amp;dn":"Loits+-+Vere+Kutse+Kohustab+%282004%29+%2AEstonian+Militant+Black+Meta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a59ab3bbd19a0385487288ffb589e8f8dccc021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,89,171,59,189,25,160,56,84,135,40,143,251,88,158,143,141,204,192,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
