Although normally classified under &quot;folk&quot;, the album is an extraordinary and seamless fusion of blues, jazz, celtic/British, bluegrass and baroque counterpoint. The music combines strong and catchy melodies, driving rhythms and strategically advanced composition. \nAn extraordinarily intense driving energy pervades this album, and as the last few notes echo in your ears, you are left with the feeling of having been in the presence of pure, bright liquid light, emanating from a pitch-black background. The pieces are hauntingly beautiful, each track highly distinctive.\n\nThis album is a master course in dialogue and composition. I've listened to it an uncountable number of times, and I'm still learning from it. If my house caught on fire and I could rescue only one album, I would choose this one.\n\n1 Tic-Tocative    \n2 Waltz    \n3 Piano Tune    \n4 Goodbye Porkpie Hat    \n5 Hole in the Coal    \n6 The Wagoner's Lad    \n7 Lucky 13    \n8 Three Part Thing    \n9 Stepping Stones    \n10 Red's Favourite    \n11 No Exit    \n12 Orlando    \n13 Bells    \n14 East Wind    \n15 After the Dance    \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e27336d96023da163dc830430104e4d67f3c75a","amp;dn":"Bert+Jansch+and+John+Renbourn...After+the+Dance%281992%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e27336d96023da163dc830430104e4d67f3c75a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,39,51,109,150,2,61,161,99,220,131,4,48,16,78,77,103,243,199,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
