According to the band, they chose the name 'April Wine' simply because members thought the two words sounded good together. The band has released more than 20 albums and continues to attract fans to its concerts, within and without Canada, more than 40 years after its beginning as a hard rock group.\n\nApril Wine began in late 1969 in Waverley, Nova Scotia (a suburb of Halifax). The original members were brothers David Henman on guitar and Ritchie Henman on drums. Their cousin Jim Henman joined in on bass, and Myles Goodwyn completed the sound on lead vocals and guitar. In early 1970 the band relocated to Montreal. Shortly after arriving in their new home the band was signed by Aquarius Records. They recorded and released their debut album April Wine in 1971. The album spawned their first single, &quot;Fast Train&quot;, which received fairly steady airplay on radio stations across Canada and established Myles Goodwyn as the band's main songwriter. The single's success gave the band's label confidence and they began a second album, but first a personnel change occurred (the first of many). Jim Henman left the band in the fall of 1971, and was replaced by Jim Clench.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5be93beca905e6b4021b8c097e08498bbef2497","amp;dn":"April+Wine+-+King+Biscuit+%5BLive%5D%5B1982%5D%5B1999%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5be93beca905e6b4021b8c097e08498bbef2497","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,190,147,190,202,144,94,107,64,33,184,192,151,224,132,152,187,239,36,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
