He is transferred to Los Angeles to help Los Angeles cop Jim Campbell solve a series of brutal murders in which the victims are crucified. The murders that have happened since Jack arrived in Los Angeles just don&amp;#039;t sit right with him. When the killer, known as the &quot;Family Man&quot;, kills Ellen DunLeavy, who happens to be Jack&amp;#039;s ex wife and the mother of his two kids, and Ellen&amp;#039;s husband Andrew DunLeavy, it becomes personal - especially when Jack&amp;#039;s prints are found on Ellen&amp;#039;s body. Jack meets with his military mentor Smith, not knowing that Smith is in cahoots with local crime boss Frank Deverell.\n\nRegion:PAL\n   \nLanguage: Dolby Digital 5.1: English, Spanish, German\n\n\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Hebrew, Polish, Greek, Czech Portuguese, Hungaro, Icelander, Croato\n\nDVD5=&gt;DVD5\n\nAnyDVD\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116421/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116421/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0d37cd1f6ec3b12f73e27039718fcfd7d604fa","amp;dn":"%5BCiclo+Steven+Seagal%5D+The+Glimmer+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0d37cd1f6ec3b12f73e27039718fcfd7d604fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,13,55,205,31,110,195,177,47,115,226,112,57,113,143,207,215,214,4,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
