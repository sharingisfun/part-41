It is generally remembered as a bleak period when civilization in the West teetered on the verge of total collapse and barbarian warlords fought with each other when they weren't busy fighting Viking hordes, Muslim invaders, or Byzantine armies.\n\n\nThe Dark Ages uses recent scholarship and high production values to recreate the period just after the fall of Rome in the late 5th century A.D. The Roman Empire in the West had collapsed and a ragtag band of barbarians made up of Goths, Vandals, Franks, and Lombards wage bloody warfare against each other to divide up the pieces of the once-great Empire. In the East, the remnants of the Empire live on under the Emperor Justinian who becomes obsessed with recapturing Rome and reconquering the West. Meanwhile, the Franks, easily the most powerful of the post-Roman tribes, have begun to establish a great kingdom under the Merovingian dynasty, led by King Clovis, whose conversion to Christianity helps secure its place in the history of Europe. \n\n\nThe documentary then touches on the Viking raids along the English and Irish coasts, the desperate struggle to crush the invading Muslim armies that threaten to capture all of Spain and France, and ultimately, the consolidation of Western Europe as part of the Holy Roman Empire under Charlemagne.\nThis is probably one of the best History Channel documentaries out there and shows that a good amount of time and effort went into create this production. While of course it cannot tell every detail of the nearly 500 year period of the Dark Ages, it does a good job of providing an excellent introduction to the subject. It is one which recommends itself to anyone who claims to be a student of history. \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: RJ Allison\n=======================\n\n\nProduced &amp; written by: Christopher Cassel \n=========================================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: The Dark Ages\nYear.................: 2007\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 01:30:44 (  ) 01:30:24 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: (AC3) \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 4:3\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 640x480 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 2392 kbit/s ( ) 2225 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: (N/A)\nFile Size:...........: 1.51 GB ( ) 1.4 GB\nFPS..................: 29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: May 29, 2007\nParts................: 2 Episodes\n\n\n \n\n   \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0972369/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0972369/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Episodes:\n    =========\n\n  1)The Dark Ages\n  2)The Plague (Bonus)\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b23915e4e31e5514460cee2c055fb8112ef4dc","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Ages-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b23915e4e31e5514460cee2c055fb8112ef4dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,178,57,21,228,227,30,85,20,70,12,238,44,5,95,184,17,46,244,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
