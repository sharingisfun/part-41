This reasoning is motivated by the pursuit of inclusiveness and broadness in the antitrust context. The work contends that traditional top-down antitrust theories are weak because they are incomplete and insufficient in their description and analysis of antitrust issues. Thus, it identifies the need to construct a bottom-up approach. Invariably, such an approach would have to avoid ex ante judgments about the suitability of the normative contents of antitrust laws and theories, lest it fall into the same trap that plagues traditional theories. As a possible solution, the author proposes a procedural account referred to as the person-centred approach (built on theories such as SenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Capability) and carefully reviews its practicality.\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description II\n*** Presents a more holistic picture of antitrust and helps to avoid the dangers resulting from half knowledge or the dogmatic application of competition rules\n*** As antitrust law is severely under-theorised, it offers a welcome addition to the very lean body of literature in this area\n*** Provides readers with a fundamental understanding of antitrust.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7300f3f67ddc888cf38c24142a3e9bd390302f","amp;dn":"Abayomi+Al-Ameen+-+Antitrust.The+Person-centred+Approach+%5B2014%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7300f3f67ddc888cf38c24142a3e9bd390302f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,115,0,243,246,125,220,136,140,243,140,36,20,42,62,155,211,144,48,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
