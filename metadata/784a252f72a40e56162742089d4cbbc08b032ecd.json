The premiere episode will follow the exploits of heroic Anti Terrorist Unit agent Jai Singh Rathod played by Anil Kapoor. Racing against time with the clock ticking, Jai Singh Rathod, is suddenly thrust into a chaotic and exhausting 24 hour marathon, of death, deceit, terror as he struggles to prevent the assassination of prime ministerial candidate Aditya Singhania. According to Kapoor, the series, which will be &quot;related to the Indian ethos&quot;, will follow an Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU), similar to the Counter Terrorism (CTU) Unit in the original series.\n\n\nNOTE: Encoded the video after obtaining it from www.desitvforum.net\n\nSpoken Language: Hindi\nTexted Language: None","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:784a252f72a40e56162742089d4cbbc08b032ecd","amp;dn":"24.%28Indian.Series%29.S01E08.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"784a252f72a40e56162742089d4cbbc08b032ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,74,37,47,114,164,14,86,22,39,66,8,157,76,187,192,139,3,46,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
