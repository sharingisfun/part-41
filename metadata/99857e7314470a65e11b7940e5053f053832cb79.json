Why won't Republicans accept things that most experts agree on? Why are they constantly fighting against the facts?\n\nScience writer Chris Mooney explores brain scans, polls, and psychology experiments to explain why conservatives today believe more wrong things; appear more likely than Democrats to oppose new ideas and less likely to change their beliefs in the face of new facts; and sometimes respond to compelling evidence by doubling down on their current beliefs.  \n\n\nGoes beyond the standard claims about ignorance or corporate malfeasance to discover the real, scientific reasons why Republicans reject the widely accepted findings of mainstream science, economics, and historyÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as many undeniable policy facts (e.g., there were no Ã¢â‚¬Å“death panelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the health care bill).\nExplains that the political parties reflect personality traits and psychological needsÃ¢â‚¬â€with Republicans more wedded to certainty, Democrats to noveltyÃ¢â‚¬â€and this is the root of our divide over reality.\nWritten by the author of The Republican War on Science, which was the first and still the most influential book to look at conservative rejection of scientific evidence. But the rejection of science is just the beginningÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nCertain to spark discussion and debate, The Republican Brain also promises to add to the lengthy list of persuasive scientific findings that Republicans reject and deny","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99857e7314470a65e11b7940e5053f053832cb79","amp;dn":"The+Republican+Brain-+The+Science+of+Why+They+Deny+Science--and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99857e7314470a65e11b7940e5053f053832cb79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,133,126,115,20,71,10,101,225,27,121,64,229,5,63,5,56,50,203,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
