Sofia Quinn has a killer smile, and by the time you're done noticing it, she's got you offering up your wallet, your car, and anything else she desires. She holds LaRoux Industries responsible for the mysterious death of her father and is out for revenge at any cost. When a LaRoux Industries security breach interrupts Gideon and Sofia's separate attempts to infiltrate their headquarters, they're forced to work together to escape. Each of them has their own reason for wanting to take down LaRoux Industries, and neither trusts the other. But working together might be the best chance they have to expose the secrets LRI is so desperate to hide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cf33960dadaa4f83e742dad903f1c0059cc62bd","amp;dn":"Starbound+Series+-+Amie+Kaufman+%26amp%3B+Megan+Spooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cf33960dadaa4f83e742dad903f1c0059cc62bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,243,57,96,218,218,164,248,62,116,45,173,144,63,28,0,89,204,98,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
