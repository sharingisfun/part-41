Catch them live, and dig this track, a scorcher from their not-yet-released CD. Call it NuPunk if you must, a rock and roll sub-genre this band has a definite handle on.&quot; -Bob Segarini\n\nOne of Toronto's best and most original bands.  With influences as diverse as Tool, Depeche Mode, and The Beatles, this multi-generational hard rock group is a must listen for any fan of classic, indie, or alternative rock!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ed2806a0e4f887dd152dc7ededc30837dd1f6f","amp;dn":"The+Bloody+Five+-+Unreleased+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ed2806a0e4f887dd152dc7ededc30837dd1f6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,237,40,6,160,228,248,135,221,21,45,199,237,237,195,8,55,221,31,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
