Wunderbar! But what parts of\nDeutschland (Germany) do you want to visit? Because of this countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nmany offerings, answering that question isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always easy. Germany\nisnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a huge country Ã¢â‚¬â€ on a superfast train you can buzz from Berlin in\nthe north to Munich in the south in about seven hours Ã¢â‚¬â€ but exciting\ncities and scenic sightseeing possibilities pack the terrain.\nSituated in the very heart of Europe, Germany stretches from the Alps in\nthe south to Denmark and the Baltic and North seas in the north. France\nbounds Germany to the southwest, with Luxembourg, Belgium, and the\nNetherlands to the west and the Czech Republic and Poland to the east.\nDramatic regional differences exist in the German landscape. The sunny\nsouthwest is where you find the Bodensee (Lake Constance), one of the\nlargest lakes in Europe, and the forested hills of the scenic Schwarzwald\n(Black Forest). In the west, every crag in the Rhine Valley seems to have\nits own romantic legend Ã¢â‚¬â€ or carefully tended vineyard. Drive or take\nthe train a couple of hours east and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in the Bavarian Alps, where\nthe peaks are tipped with snow until May. In the far north, the location\nof the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great ports, you find a flat maritime landscape.\nRegional differences also extend to food and architecture. The sober\nbrick architecture that predominates in the far north gives way to exuberant\nbaroque churches and palaces in the south. In the southwest,\nwhich shares a border with France, French cuisine is a major part of the\ndining scene. In the north, near GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coastline, the emphasis is on\nfresh seafood. Every city or region has its own version of sausage and its\nfavorite local wines and beers. Discovering the special regional differences\nwithin Germany will help to deepen your understanding and experiences\nof the country.\nSo what cities, regions, or specific attractions do you want to see? Berlin,\nthe exciting new capital of a reunified republic? Elegant, fun-loving Munich,\nthe city where most Germans would live if they could? The great port\ncity of Hamburg? The romantic university town of Heidelberg? Are there\nspecific landscapes you want to see, such as the Bavarian Alps or the\nRhine Valley? Did you know that one of the most beautiful scenic drives\nin Europe is along GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aptly named Romantic Road? What castles\nand cathedrals would you like to visit? The fairy-tale castles built by\nKing Ludwig of Bavaria are the most famous and popular attractions in\nGermany. The sheer size of Cologne Cathedral, the largest church north\nof the Alps, will dazzle your senses, too. And how about other historic\nsites?
