It was mainly recorded in Columbia Studio A, Nashville, from September 22 to 26, 1970. &quot;Sing Another Song, Boys&quot; was recorded at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 30, 1970. Further recording took place at Trident Studios in London. The album reached #145 on the Billboard list, but was his most commercially successful album in many other parts of the world, reaching #4 in the UK and #8 in Australia.[3]\n\nThe album title is descriptive, outlining its main themes. The songs contain emotive language and are frankly personal; &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; ends with the line &quot;Sincerely, L. Cohen&quot;. The back cover of the album bears the lines:\n\nThey locked up a man\nWho wanted to rule the world\nThe fools\nThey locked up the wrong man\n\nA remastered CD was released in 1995. Simply Vinyl issued a short-lived remastered edition on vinyl in 2002, making it the last Cohen album (aside from Ten New Songs, which was pressed in limited quantities) to go out of print on vinyl.\n\nIn 2007 Columbia/Legacy released a newly remastered CD with a new book style packaging and a bonus track: a 1968 recording of Dress Rehearsal Rag.\n\nIn 2009 the album (including its bonus track) was included in the 8-CD box set Hallelujah - The Essential Leonard Cohen Album Collection, issued by Sony Music in the Netherlands.\n\nIt was ranked 74 on Pitchfork Media's list of the 100 best albums of the 1970s.\n\n\n\nSongs:\n\nWith the exception of &quot;Last Year's Man&quot;, Cohen has performed every song live. Because of its depressing content, Cohen has played &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; in concert only on two occasions, two years before Songs of Love and Hate.\n\nJudy Collins recorded &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; in 1966 on the album In My Life, years before it would appear on Songs of Love and Hate.\n\nNick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds recorded a version of &quot;Avalanche&quot; for their 1984 album From Her to Eternity.\n\n&quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; has been covered numerous times, notably by Jennifer Warnes, who once toured as a back-up singer for Cohen, on her 1987 tribute album to Cohen, Famous Blue Raincoat. It has also been covered by Tori Amos on the Leonard Cohen tribute album Tower of Song. Warnes also covered &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; on Famous Blue Raincoat as a duet with Cohen.\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\n* Leonard Cohen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitar, vocals\n* Ron Cornelius ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic and electric guitars\n* Charlie Daniels ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitar, bass, fiddle\n* Elkin &quot;Bubba&quot; Fowler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitar, banjo, bass\n* Bob Johnston ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano, production\n* Corlynn Hanney ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n* Susan Mussmano ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n* The Corona Academy, London ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ children's voices\n* Michael Sahl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ strings on 3rd verse of &quot;Last Year's Man&quot;\n* Paul Buckmaster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ string and horn arrangements, conductor\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Love_and_Hate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Love_and_Hate&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview from Pitchfork.com\n\nOf course, any seeker can become lost, and on 1971's Songs of Love and Hate, Cohen shows signs of disorientation. Though he's backed by a crew of ace musicians, including Charlie Daniels on fiddle, the record is thinner and less even than the first two. In contrast to his early precision, Cohen takes some wild swings that miss the mark, such as the weird Santa Claus imagery on &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot; and the uncomfortably strained singing style he adopts on &quot;Diamonds in the Mine&quot;, which might be chalked up to an insecurity about his voice encouraged by his negative press. It's also a more blatantly depressive album than the first two, lacking hopeful equanimity, and does indeed reflect a period of great depression and uncertainty in Cohen's life.\n\nBut elsewhere on Love and Hate, he's in his finest, subtlest form-- &quot;Avalanche&quot;, &quot;Last Year's Man&quot;, and &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; alone justify the album's classic status. Despite its relative flaws, it's an indispensable document in the development of one of the 20th century's most enduring artists. Cohen potently captures the pull between safety and the unknown, love and freedom, spirituality and sensuality: a panoramic view of human experience, rendered through the work of one exceptional artist.\n\n\nFull review:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11901-songs-of-leonard-cohensongs-from-a-roomsongs-of-love-and-hate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11901-songs-of-leonard-cohensongs-from-a-roomsongs-of-love-and-hate/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nAll songs written by Leonard Cohen.\n[edit] Side one\n\n01.
