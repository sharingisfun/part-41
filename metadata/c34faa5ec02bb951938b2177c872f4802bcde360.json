She was the middle child of three and her father, David Nemerov, owned a large Fifth Avenue department \nstore called Russek's. She grew up on Central Park West and attended the Ethical Culture and Fieldston Schools. At the age of fourteen, she met Allan Arbus and they were married four years later. They became fashion photographers and, for a number of years, worked for most of the major fashion magazines in the United States. In 1959, Diane studied photography with Lisette Model who, in a sense, gave her the license to seriously pursue her own work. She received Guggenheim Fellowships in 1963 and 1966","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c34faa5ec02bb951938b2177c872f4802bcde360","amp;dn":"Diane+Arbus+%28Photo+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c34faa5ec02bb951938b2177c872f4802bcde360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,79,170,94,192,43,185,81,147,139,33,119,200,114,244,128,43,205,227,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
