Forget about the old muddy sounding older releases... Here you get the greatest Genesis records in the best sounding version. Normally I'm not a fan of new mixed classic's because mostly they're sounding heavily compressed and equalized. But these records sound like I wished to hear them all the time. It turn some of the greatest ProgRock records into a great experience!!!\n\n\nTechnical Informations:\n\nMusic Hall MMF 5.1 Turntable\nGoldring 1042 reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nAudacity 1.3.5 Recording Software\nClickRepair 3.0.1 with extremly light settings (DeClick 10/DeCrackle 0) has been used to remove some clicks present due to static charge of the vinyl.\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS THE 3*, STAY TUNE FOR THE OTHER\n\n\nFoxtrot (1972)\n\n\n\n\nAll songs by Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford.\n\nSide one\n1. &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:21\n2. &quot;Time Table&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n3. &quot;Get 'Em Out by Friday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:36\n4. &quot;Can-Utility and the Coastliners&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n\nSide two\n1. &quot;Horizons&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:39\n2. &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 22:54\n\n1. &quot;Lover's Leap&quot;\n2. &quot;The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man&quot;\n3. &quot;Ikhnaton and Itsacon and Their Band of Merry Men&quot;\n4. &quot;How Dare I Be So Beautiful?&quot;\n5. &quot;Willow Farm&quot;\n6. &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8 (co-starring the delicious talents of Gabble Ratchet)&quot;\n7. &quot;As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs (Aching Men's Feet)&quot;\n\nPersonnel\n* Peter Gabriel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, flute, percussion, oboe\n* Steve Hackett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n* Tony Banks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, guitar, piano, electric piano, mellotron, vocals\n* Mike Rutherford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, guitar, vocals, bass pedals, cello\n* Phil Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion, vocals\n\n\nWhile burning you should add a gap of approx 3 seconds between each track!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42ff0334b30f428d23073f43b9bf8d6a0fa65a4","amp;dn":"Genesis-Foxtrot%281972%29%282008+Vinyl+Box%29%5BVinyl+Rip-FLAC%5D%5BTWR108%5D%5BCR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42ff0334b30f428d23073f43b9bf8d6a0fa65a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,47,240,51,75,48,244,40,210,48,115,244,59,155,248,214,160,250,101,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
