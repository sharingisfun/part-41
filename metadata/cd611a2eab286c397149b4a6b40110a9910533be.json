The songwriting is very much in a storytelling style, and although there is a slight hint of pop to the songs it's the folk and blues influences that really shine through. Although every song is replete with understated beauty, some personal favorites include the opener &quot;I'd be broken&quot;, the more upbeat &quot;I'll see you&quot;, &quot;Tell me you're joking&quot;, and &quot;I'll remember you&quot;.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/sophie-zelmani/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/sophie-zelmani/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd611a2eab286c397149b4a6b40110a9910533be","amp;dn":"Sophie+Zelmani...Sophie+Zelmani%281996%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd611a2eab286c397149b4a6b40110a9910533be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,97,26,46,171,40,108,57,113,73,180,166,180,1,16,169,145,5,51,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
