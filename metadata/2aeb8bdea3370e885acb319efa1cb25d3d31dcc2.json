His specific violations of our Constitution, in addition to his actions in furtherance of conspiracies to commit further heinous crimes, make him eligible for immediate impeachment, and removal from office. \n\nIn fact, if these measures are not pursued immediately, the damage to the United States and its citizens, and humanity as a whole, could be irreparableÃ¢â‚¬â€including through the provocation of nuclear war. \n\nThose who argue that this President's misconduct has not risen to the Constitutional level of &quot;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,&quot; are either delusional, or incorrigibly corrupt. Obama's offenses have already gone far beyond those of President Richard M. Nixon, whose bills of impeachment recounted how he had &quot;acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.&quot; \n\nPrestigious lawyers, including Bruce Fein and Professor Francis Boyle, have already stepped forward to offer their services in drafting bills of impeachment against Obama. It is a matter of utmost urgency that leading political circles, as well as the U.S. population, take the necessary action to get Congress to act. \n\nWe hereby provide a draft outline for a formal Bill of Impeachment. (For more elaboration on the Conspiracy counts, see EIR's previous coverage at www.larouchepub.com) It's your responsibility to join us in getting the process going now. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://larouchepac.com/node/20212&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://larouchepac.com/node/20212&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aeb8bdea3370e885acb319efa1cb25d3d31dcc2","amp;dn":"Toward+A+Bill+of+Impeachment+Of+Barack+Hussein+Obama.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aeb8bdea3370e885acb319efa1cb25d3d31dcc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,235,139,222,163,55,14,136,90,203,49,158,250,28,178,93,61,49,220,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
