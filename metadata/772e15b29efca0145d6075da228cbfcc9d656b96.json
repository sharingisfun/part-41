Deciding they needed a more prominent front man, they added lead vocalist Charlie Ware within their first year. Other original band members included Tony Sanfilippo, guitar; Rob Brown, bass; and Scott Ã¢â‚¬Å“ScootsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bauer, drums.\nWith the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful rock sound and WareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spastic dancing, the band became a huge local draw. The band signed to Relativity Records and released Ã¢â‚¬Å“JaundiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1994. The band toured extensively throughout the United States in support of the record. The song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Treasure HandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ received extensive airplay, especially in Southern California.\n\nInternal struggles within the band led to drummer Bauer leaving, replaced by Scott Clark. But the band members felt their record company never fully supported them, and friction between the band and its management with Relativity led to the band being dropped from the label. The group broke up briefly. In 1998, the band reunited and recorded a new CD Ã¢â‚¬Å“How to Survive an Air CrashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on SRH Records. Although Santos wrote the bulk of the material and played on two tracks, he had left the band. LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fur Coat continued as a four-piece and soldiered on, mostly playing at local clubs. However, the band failed to generate major label interest and again the group broke up. LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fur Coat has reunited several times over the years for one-off shows, some of which have included Santos.\n\nWare and Sanfilippo formed the band Pumphouse with Petey X of Rocket from the Crypt. Santos and Brown formed the country band The Scramblers with former members of Malachi Crunch and Deadbolt. Santos later formed the group The Coolest Band in America in 2004, which released CDs Ã¢â‚¬Å“Air ConditionedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Memo.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\nTreasure Hands\nFalling Out\t\nSuper\nStill I Complain\nEasy\nSensor\nElementary\nSame\nInsanity\nNot My Fault\nSouthern Cookin'\n747\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:772e15b29efca0145d6075da228cbfcc9d656b96","amp;dn":"Lucys+Fur+Coat+-+Jaundice+1994+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"772e15b29efca0145d6075da228cbfcc9d656b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,46,21,178,158,252,160,20,93,96,117,218,34,140,191,204,157,101,107,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
