You can surf the web, manage your e-mails and photos, do office work, play videos or music and have a lot of fun.\n\nopenSUSE 12.3 is released bringing the best which Free and Open Source Software has to offer. Much attention in this shorter-than-normal cycle went into details and stability. This includes deeper integration of systemd and improvements to package management as well as a move to 1gb images for the live systems. New are UEFI and experimental Secure Boot support, stable ARMv7 and experimental ARM 64bit images, the KDE Plasma 4.10 desktop, a touch of cloud with OpenStack, Postgresql 9.2 and MariaDB and the latest development tools and libraries.\n\nFind out more on &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.opensuse.org/?p=15299&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.opensuse.org/?p=15299&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c7cc2d52739e70999ccff474ac9593fac74624f","amp;dn":"openSUSE+Linux+12.3+KDE+%2864-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c7cc2d52739e70999ccff474ac9593fac74624f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,124,194,213,39,57,231,9,153,204,255,71,74,201,89,63,172,116,98,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
