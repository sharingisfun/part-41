Chuck in a lively canter through some Christmas gift ideas and ace film director Danny Boyle as the star in the Reasonably Priced Car and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got a mighty fine way to take your mind off all those news stories about TRAVEL CHAOS and endless bloody songs with sleigh bells in them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f349d69603f3d5a2f1d891d5e4eccb24e108d59b","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+Specials+December+21st+2010+USA+Road+Trip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f349d69603f3d5a2f1d891d5e4eccb24e108d59b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,73,214,150,3,243,213,162,241,216,145,213,228,236,203,36,225,8,213,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
