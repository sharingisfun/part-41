Rose briefly considers leaving Norman but dismisses the idea: Norman is a policeman, and is excellent at finding people. Norman also has a violent temper and was recently accused of assaulting an African-American woman named Wendy Yarrow. The subsequent lawsuit and Internal Affairs investigation has made him even more volatile.\n\nThe story then jumps ahead to a morning nine years later, when Rose is making the bed. She notices a drop of blood on the sheet that had probably leaked from her nose the night before ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Norman had punched her in the face for spilling some iced tea on him. Rose realizes that she has passively suffered through Norman's abuse for fourteen years and that if she continues to put up with this treatment, she might be killed. But then Rose wonders: what if Norman doesn't kill her? What will she be like after fourteen more years of Norman &quot;talking to her right up close&quot;, as he puts it?\n\nEnjoy, and please seed with me.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3cd2a9fe336d50db39283e204d667cb9d4a0ee7","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+Rose+Madder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3cd2a9fe336d50db39283e204d667cb9d4a0ee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,205,42,159,227,54,213,13,179,146,131,226,4,214,103,203,157,74,14,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
