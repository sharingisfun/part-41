This book starts from the beginning-- defining the Internet, the Web, browsers, and URLs -- so you don't need to have any previous knowledge about how the Web works. After reading this book, you'll have a solid foundation in HTML, graphics, and design principles that you can immediately put to use in creating effective web pages.\n\nIn the second edition, Jennifer has updated the book to cover style sheets and reflect current web standards. She has also added exercises that help you to learn various techniques and short quizzes that make sure you're up to speed with key concepts. The companion CD-ROM contains material for all the exercises in the book, as well as trial versions of FireworksÃ‚Â® MX, and HomeSiteÃ¢â€žÂ¢ 5; Adobe Ã‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â® 7, ImageReadyÃ‚Â® 7, and BBEdit 7.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fab717e67be2712de530713606b52a1a2ad9334","amp;dn":"Learning+Web+Design+A+Beginner%27s+Guide+ML%2C+CSS%2C+Graphics%2C+and+Be","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fab717e67be2712de530713606b52a1a2ad9334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,171,113,126,103,190,39,18,222,83,7,19,96,107,82,161,162,173,147,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
