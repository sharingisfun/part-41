Born Beryl Clutterbuck in the middle of England, she and her father moved to Kenya when she was a girl, and she grew up with a zebra for a pet; horses for friends; baboons, lions, and gazelles for neighbors. She made money by scouting elephants from a tiny plane. And she would spend most of the rest of her life in East Africa as an adventurer, a racehorse trainer, and an aviatrixÃ¢â‚¬â€she became the first person to fly nonstop from Europe to America, the first woman to fly solo east to west across the Atlantic. Hers was indisputably a life full of adventure and beauty.\n     And then there is the writing. When Hemingway read MarkhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, he wrote to his editor, Maxwell Perkins: Ã¢â‚¬Å“She has written so well, and marvelously well, that I was completely ashamed of myself as a writer . . . [She] can write rings around all of us who consider ourselves as writers . . . It is really a bloody wonderful book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db997138335211048413490ebe61caf378a2260","amp;dn":"Markham+-+West+With+The+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db997138335211048413490ebe61caf378a2260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,185,151,19,131,53,33,16,72,65,52,144,235,230,28,175,55,138,34,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
