During a RAID array failure, I lost three of the songs; fortunately I was able to find them, but I realized that Tokyo Pinsalocks' music is literally vanishing from the Internet. Torrents are completely gone, and you can't buy most of the CDs in this torrent no matter how hard you try. Rather than risk losing these wonderful songs forever, I decided to toss up a torrent so that you can enjoy them as much as I have.\n\nWhen you finish, please seed.\n\nDirectory listing:\n\nTokyo Pinsalocks/:\nTokyo Pinsalocks - Oneway Generation.mp3\n\nTokyo Pinsalocks/(2001.10.24) Pedicure:\n01 - Pedicure.mp3\n02 - Hei!
