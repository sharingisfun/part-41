Songs Alan had been singing on the folk club circuit for years, but now had been given extra sharpness and clarity by his Geordie mates gathered around him. We also get one song from Rod Clements and one from band mate Rab Noakes. All of Lindisfarne were multi instrumentalists, so there was always plenty of swapping of instruments on stage.\nThere are protest songs mixed in with love songs, ballads, and kick up your heels barn dances. But through it all there is a feeling of fun and kindred spirit. Alan Hull singing 'The Winter Song' would send shivers down any spine. 'Clear White Light Part Two' is the first song Lindisfarne ever played together, and was the final encore when they once and for all called it a day at their final concert November 1st, 2003 - naturally at the Newcastle City Hall.''\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01.
