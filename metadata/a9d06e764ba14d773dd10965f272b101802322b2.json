Featuring acclaimed author Dr. Jack Shaheen, the film explores a long line of degrading images of Arabs--from Bedouin bandits and submissive maidens to sinister sheikhs and gun-wielding &quot;terrorists&quot;--along the way offering devastating insights into the origin of these stereotypic images, their development at key points in US history, and why they matter so much today. Shaheen shows how the persistence of these images over time has served to naturalize prejudicial attitudes toward Arabs and Arab culture, in the process reinforcing a narrow view of individual Arabs and the effects of specific US domestic and internationl policies on their lives. By inspiring critical thinking about the social, political, and basic human consequences of leaving these Hollywood caricatures unexamined, the film challenges viewers to recognize the urgent need for counter-narratives that do justice to the diversity and humanity of Arab people and the reality and richness of Arab history and culture.\n\nFile Name ..........: Reel.Bad.Arabs.How.Hollywood.Vilifies.A.People.XviD.MP3.avi\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 700.10 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\n\nVideo Length .......: 00:50:11\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1792 KB/s\nResolution .........: 656 x 480\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.36:1\nFramerate ..........: 29.97 FPS\nQuality Factor .....: 0.189 B/px\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 158 KB/s (VBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d06e764ba14d773dd10965f272b101802322b2","amp;dn":"Reel.Bad.Arabs.How.Hollywood.Vilifies.A.People.XviD.MP3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d06e764ba14d773dd10965f272b101802322b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,208,110,118,75,161,77,119,61,209,9,101,242,114,177,1,128,35,34,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
