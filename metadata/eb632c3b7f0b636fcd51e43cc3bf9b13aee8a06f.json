Sjoerd starts with a blank scene and immediately begins placing custom meshes and then goes into mobile materials, particles, sounds, and fog. Sjoerd then demonstrates setting up the plane, creating a joystick to control the plane, adding speed/fire buttons, creating destroyable ground targets using prefabs, adding a scoring system and time limits, creating the full HUD and compiling the final. Finally Sjoerd goes into great detail demonstrating how his team ported Ã¢â‚¬Å“The BallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from PC to iOS. \n\nYou will also learn from an Unreal Master exactly how to create or port your games to iOS for playing on iphone/ipad devices.
