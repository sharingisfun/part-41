Although the group's music was frequently so light it virtually disappeared, they did record a pair of classic new wave singles with the effervescent &amp;quot;Love Plus One&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl).&amp;quot; Although much of the record lacks the hooks of those two tracks, there's a handful of enjoyably breezy pop songs on Pelican West, such as &amp;quot;Fantastic Day&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Snow Girl,&amp;quot; that makes it worth investigating for new wave fetishists. Still, there's no denying that Haircut 100's material was often inadequate -- a situation only emphasized on the American edition of the album, which places the singles at the front -- and that the record sounded like a period piece just a few years after its release.\nSearch for KingStar to find my torrents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f7c1ee5c864a0e8f1ae4f4f5c1fd6ba6f2b4769","amp;dn":"Haircut+100+-+Pelican+West+++Plus+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D+%40256+Kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f7c1ee5c864a0e8f1ae4f4f5c1fd6ba6f2b4769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,124,30,229,200,100,160,232,241,174,79,79,92,31,214,186,111,43,71,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
