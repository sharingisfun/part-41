Put A Little Lovin' On Me\n\nStylistically, Mahan shows his blues influence all over the place. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hard driving sound to the opener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Math,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Mahan knocks it out of the ballpark with his sense of humor. It is a downright blast to listen to, and Mahan pulls it off with a heavy dose of charms. He strikes a soulful tone on the Kid Rock-ish Ã¢â‚¬Å“Favorite Shirt,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which has gotten quite a bit of attention as of late, as he also does on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Money In The Bank.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMahan proves himself to be a top notch singer, as evidenced on the cut Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tequila Y Mota,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his songwriting that I think is the most appealing aspect of this album. Kudos to him for writing Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Hills of South Dakota,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ after all, the state doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a lot of musical air time, does it? Maybe the best pair of songs on the album are the totally irreverent and politically incorrect Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mama Found My BongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“RehabÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s For Quitters.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The above mentioned cuts showcase MahanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genius as a tunesmith.\n\nIronically, the song that might have the best chance for airplay is one from the Bare catalog, a late 70s gem titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Put A Little LovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ On Me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I could see this being really big in the Americana / Texas market. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to hear more from Mahan. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got the vocal chops, the writing, and the humor to pull them off. \n\nThe warm, natural sound at the heart of Blame Bobby Bare is deliberate, says Mahan, who insisted that the album be recorded with vintage analog gear. Tracked to 24-track, two-Ã‚ï¿½inch tape, the music was then mixed and mastered to preserve the music's natural dynamics (i.e., no brickwalling). &quot;I truly believe music sounds better when it ebbs and flows. Much of that's been lost today where loudness is king, which is why so many albums sound like a shouting match instead of a conversation.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a74a93fbe115d271bf079ed1cb3fa2311631be","amp;dn":"Rich+Mahan+-+Blame+Bobby+Bare+%5B2012%5D%5B+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a74a93fbe115d271bf079ed1cb3fa2311631be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,167,74,147,251,225,21,210,113,191,7,158,209,203,63,162,49,22,49,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
