The present Team B II report is based entirely on unclassified, readily available sources. As with the original Team B analysis, however, this study challenges the assumptions underpinning the official line in the conflict with today's totalitarian threat, which is currently euphemistically described as &quot;violent extremism,&quot; and the policies of co-existence, accommodation and submission that are rooted in those assumptions.\n\nAuthor: William Boykin, et al.\nPublisher: Center for Security Policy\nPublication Date: September 22, 2010\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5030b3f572991d19ffddf671359bc4a229084d03","amp;dn":"Patrick+Poole+-+Shariah%3A+The+Threat+To+America+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5030b3f572991d19ffddf671359bc4a229084d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,48,179,245,114,153,29,25,255,221,246,113,53,155,196,162,41,8,77,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
