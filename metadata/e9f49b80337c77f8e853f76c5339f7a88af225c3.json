A cryptic call has warned of looming danger to the ailing queenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son and grandsonÃ¢â‚¬â€the next two heirs in line for the throne. And when the source of that ominous information, a notorious tabloid publisher, dies mysteriously, the royal family has reason to fear a genuine conspiracy. But they also suspect that the enemy lies withinÃ¢â‚¬â€and no one at Buckingham Palace, or even the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Secret Intelligence Service, can be trusted. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Malone to discover the truth. Matching wits with a power-mad politician and a vicious royal blue blood, he must race against time through the streets of London to the forbidden reaches of Iceland, all to stop a monstrous plot to seize the monarchyÃ¢â‚¬â€one that stretches back to the time of Arthur.\n\nFull Retail ePub.
