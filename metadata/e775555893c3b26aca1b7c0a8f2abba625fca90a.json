A cover of Stiff Little Fingersâ€™ 1980 punk anthem â€œTin Soldiersâ€ sets the tone for the rest of the album. \r\nAs the band started to write songs designed to get a club full of ruffians pumping their fists in unison, they also turned the world onto the patented brand of biting-yet-tuneful ska epitomized by â€œSomeday I Suppose.â€  (itunes.apple.com)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/MadwmaD.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
