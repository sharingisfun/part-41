We think conversation should be easily shared between all of your devices, not trapped as text messages on your phone. Here's how we do it:\n\n\u0007 INSTANT MESSAGING: Your unique Trillian username can be used to send unlimited messages free of charge. Trillian uses your existing data plan and/or WiFi.\n\n\u0007 ANYWHERE: Trillian's continuous client feature delivers your chats instantly between all of your connected devices. In addition, Trillian automatically silences push notifications on mobile devices if you're active on a desktop - no more dealing with a phone buzzing on your desk all day!\n\n\u0007 SIMPLE: Trillian places a strong emphasis on fast and reliable message delivery and a beautiful, easy-to-use interface.\n\n\u0007 SECURE: All communication with Trillian servers uses TLS to ensure third-parties can't read your chats.\n\n\u0007 INTEROPERABLE: Of course, Trillian wouldn't be Trillian without support for Facebook Chat, MSN, Google Talk, AIM, ICQ, Yahoo!, and Jabber.\n\nRecent changes:\n\u0007 Modernized user interface with ICS+ compatibility.\n\u0007 Easily start group chats with your friends who also use Trillian.\n\u0007 Optionally import names and photos from your address book.\n\u0007 For the Trillian network, appear as mobile to your Trillian contacts.\n\u0007 Shiny new emoticons.\n\u0007 Manage and view all connected devices.\n\u0007 Compatibility with in-house Trillian Server deployments.\n\u0007 Improvements for Yahoo! and MSN connectivity.\n\n\nMore Info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceruleanstudios.trillian.android&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceruleanstudios.trillian.android&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f558fec0621d05eca973bff83be69442f873fd6c","amp;dn":"Trillian+PRO+v2.0.0.78+%5Bmindcrasher%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f558fec0621d05eca973bff83be69442f873fd6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,88,254,192,98,29,5,236,169,115,191,248,59,230,148,66,248,115,253,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
