I know what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re thinkingÃ¢â‚¬â€Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is saying the same thing. But in his case itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably not true... and in his case thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not good news. But Premiere is going to renew my contract for another year, so the good news is that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m staying put. The bad news is that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in Florida, but that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to affect you. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not going to go away, no matter what Republicans might want. In that sense, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m like ObamacareÃ¢â‚¬â€IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just a lot easier to access. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because I have a much better website.\n\nMichele Bachmann claims that she has lost her health insurance under Obamacare. To be fair, Michele often loses a lot of thingsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ like her train of thought. Michele said Ã¢â‚¬Å“I lost my health insurance under Obamacare. And so now IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m forced to go into the D.C. health exchange.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That could be trouble. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure that Michele has a hard time understanding how to turn on a computer, let alone navigate a website. Michele, just have one of your staff members navigate the healthcare website for you. And make sure they get you a plan that covers mental health. Michele said Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have a husband with very significant health issues.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Well donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look to Obamacare for that, MicheleÃ¢â‚¬â€it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover gay conversion therapy. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not clear how Obamacare would cause Michele Bachmann to lose any health insurance she had before. The people who are losing their policies are the morons who bought worthless policies... oh, wait, now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all making perfect sense.\n\nIf you want to feel better about American politicians, you really should be paying attention to the saga of Toronto mayor Rob Ford. In addition to crack smoking and drunkeness, Ford has been accused of sexual harassment and abusive behavior. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a one-man Canadian version of Breaking Bad. Ford is what would happen if you took Chris Christie and put that lap band around the artery that supplies blood to the brain.\n\nFordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest escapade is to deny that he sought to perform oral sex on a female staffer. The problem is that he made his denial on live TVÃ¢â‚¬â€using the most graphic language imaginable. Rob, the only time you use that phrase is when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re actually doing it! Shame on you for your language, Rob Ford! Do you kiss your wife with that mouth? Oops, there were better ways to have phrased that...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f091f7013fa86b8b8e70bd4e9ad79cdb9396c2ae","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+15+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f091f7013fa86b8b8e70bd4e9ad79cdb9396c2ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,145,247,1,63,168,107,139,142,112,189,78,154,215,156,219,147,150,194,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
