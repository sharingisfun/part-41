USB Disk Security is the best antivirus software to permanently protect offline computer without the need for signature updates, but other antivirus  software should update signature database regularly, and they cannot effectively protect offline computer. This light and easy to use solution is 100% compatible with all software and doesn't slow down your computer at all. You pay USB Disk Security once and get it all, however, other antivirus products should be paid for updates every year.\n\n+------------------+\n|Product Highlights|\n+------------------+\n\n\n- 100% protection against any malicious programs via USB storage\n\nThe best solution to protect offline computer Other antivirus software should update signature database regularly, and they cannot effectively protect offline computer that is not connected to the Internet. When new viruses, worms and other malicious attacks strike, traditional signatures are insufficient. Every minute one waits for a virus signature update creates a window of vulnerability that could have devastating consequences. USB Disk Security uses advanced proactive detection techniques, requires no signature updates, and closes the window of vulnerability left open by other reactive, signature-based responses.\n\n- The world's fastest and smallest antivirus software\n\nWith USB Disk Security, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not necessary to sacrifice speed for detection and scanning. Compare antivirus software and you'll discover that USB Disk Security is by far one of the smallest applications in the industry. For example, the v5.0 of USB Disk Security installer is just 1 MB. The program utilizes approximately 1 to 7 MB of RAM.\n\n- 100% compatible with all software\n\nIncompatibility between antivirus programs is an issue. In the vast majority of cases, installing two antivirus programs from different vendors on one machine (for increased protection) is technically impossible, as the two programs will disrupt each other's functioning. However, USB Disk Security is 100% compatible with all software, including Windows Vista.\n\n- Simple to use\n\nUSB Disk Security has been specifically designed to perform effectively regardless of the userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s level of computer expertise. Just install and forget it.\n\n\n+-------------+\n|Install Notes| \n+-------------+              \n\n- Install the software.\n\n- Register it using provided serials.\n\n- Enjoy!    \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3809055c87c199829b939bc0b15dfffd6d363da1","amp;dn":"USB+Disk+Security+5.4.0.12+%2B+Serials-%5BHB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3809055c87c199829b939bc0b15dfffd6d363da1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,9,5,92,135,193,153,130,155,147,155,192,177,93,255,253,109,54,61,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
