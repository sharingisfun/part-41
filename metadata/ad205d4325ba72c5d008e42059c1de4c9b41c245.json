Produced by longtime friend/label founder/Sexyback bringer Timberlake and Austin, TX guitar hero Charlie Sexton, the 13 tracks that populate When Everything Breaks Open juggle genres defiantly but effectively, begging comparisons to everyone from Jason Mraz and James Blunt to Coldplay and Stevie Wonder. Throughout it all, the glue that holds the often disparate (and occasionally over-produced) worlds together is MorrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fluid croon, a swooning, R&amp;B-tinged sub-falsetto that is as effortless as it is agreeable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad205d4325ba72c5d008e42059c1de4c9b41c245","amp;dn":"Matt+Morris+-+When+Everything+Breaks+Open%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad205d4325ba72c5d008e42059c1de4c9b41c245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,32,93,67,37,186,114,197,208,8,228,32,89,193,222,76,155,65,194,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
