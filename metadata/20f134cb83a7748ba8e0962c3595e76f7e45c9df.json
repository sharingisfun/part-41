More than 3,500 miles away, the Swedish liner Stockholm leaves New York to return home to Gothenburg.\n\nSeven days later, the two liners mysteriously collide in the North Atlantic. One of the worst maritime accidents of the 20th century, the sinking of the Andrea Doria was unsolved for nearly 50 years.\n\nDEEP SEA DETECTIVES reveals why an official maritime inquiry ended prematurely and explores the inconclusive reports which left critical questions unanswered. And then John Chatterton and Ritchie Kohler conduct a full-scale investigation that culminates with a dive on the wreck.\n\nDrawing on the best evidence available, THE ANDREA DORIA: TRAGEDY AT SEA uses stunning computer graphics to re-create the fatal collision that sent the Italian liner to the ocean floor.\n\nFile Size ------- 348mb\nLength ---------- 43:43\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\nTracked and seeded by thehashden.com\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f134cb83a7748ba8e0962c3595e76f7e45c9df","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Deep+Sea+Detectives+-+The+Andrea+Doria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f134cb83a7748ba8e0962c3595e76f7e45c9df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,241,52,203,131,167,116,139,168,224,150,44,53,149,231,111,126,69,201,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
