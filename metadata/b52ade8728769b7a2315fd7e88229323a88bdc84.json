He is widely regarded as one of the founders of the gangsta rap sub-genre and initially rose to fame as the founder and member of the group N.W.A., but later achieved critical and commercial success as a solo artist. Eazy-E&amp;#039;s vocal style was marked by his youthful, high-pitched voice and his lyrics focusing on the elements of urban street life such as guns, drugs, relations between residents and the police, and deviant sexual activity.[1] He had also for some time hosted a hip-hop radio show on Los Angeles-based radio station KKBT.[2]\n\n\nEric Wright, the son of Ahmed and Kathie Wright, dropped out of high school in the tenth grade and supported himself by selling drugs with Ahmed Saaoud, both later receiving a high school equivalency diploma. He used the profits from his drug sales to establish the Ruthless Records rap music label.[2] When Ruthless signees Dr. Dre and Ice Cube wrote &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot;, Ahmed Saaoud and Eazy E formed the group N.W.A, joining other rappers Dr. Dre and Ice Cube and later adding DJ Yella and Arabian Prince.[3]\n\nThe subsequent period saw Ruthless Records release the compilation N.W.A and the Posse (1987), N.W.A&amp;#039;s proper debut Straight Outta Compton (1988), and one month later, Eazy-E&amp;#039;s solo album, Eazy-Duz-It. The album sold two million copies, certifying it as a double platinum album, and spawned the hit singles &quot;We Want Eazy&quot; and &quot;Eazy-Er Said Than Dunn&quot; (a remix of &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot;, a previous hit, was also included). The album was again produced by N.W.A&amp;#039;s Dr. Dre and DJ Yella and largely written by fellow N.W.A rapper Ice Cube, with contributions from MC Ren and The D.O.C. (whose solo No One Can Do It Better would be released the following year).\n\nEazy-Duz-It\n\nEazy-Duz-It is the debut album from late rapper Eazy-E (of N.W.A.), released in 1988.\nThe production was done by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella. Eazy-Duz-It helped popularize gangsta rap along with N.W.A&amp;#039;s debut album Straight Outta Compton. It has sold over two million copies. The album reached No. 41 on The Billboard 200.\n\nIn 2003, the album was remastered and it also included Eazy-E&amp;#039;s EP 5150: Home 4 tha Sick.\n\n\n\n\n Tracks \n\n1 (Prelude)\n2 &quot;Still Talkin&quot; Ice Cube, The D.O.C. 3:50  \n3 &quot;Nobody Move&quot; MC Ren 4:49  \n4 &quot;Ruthless Villain&quot; MC Ren 2:59  \n5 &quot;2 Hard Mutha&amp;#039;s&quot; MC Ren 4:26  \n6 &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot; (remix) 6:22 \n7 &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot; 4:21 \n7 &quot;We Want Eazy&quot; Dr. Dre, MC Ren 5:01 \n8 &quot;Eazy-er Said Than Dunn&quot; 3:41 \n9 &quot;Radio&quot; Dr. Dre, MC Ren 4:58 \n10 &quot;No More Question&amp;#039;s&quot; 3:55 \n11 &quot;I&amp;#039;mma Break It Down&quot; 3:29 \n12 &quot;Eazy-Chapter 8 Verse 10&quot; 2:11\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b52ade8728769b7a2315fd7e88229323a88bdc84","amp;dn":"Eazy+E+-+Eazy+Duz+It+1988+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b52ade8728769b7a2315fd7e88229323a88bdc84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,42,222,135,40,118,155,122,35,21,253,126,136,34,147,35,168,139,220,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
