But the 9/11 terrorist attacks opened a rift in the collective national psyche: Increasingly, Americans are abandoning reality and retreating to Internet-based fantasy worlds conjured into existence out of our own fears and prejudices. The most disturbing symptom of this trend is the 9/11 Truth movement, whose members believe that Bush administration officials engineered the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as a pretext to launch wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But these &quot;Truthers&quot; are merely one segment of a vast conspiracist subculture that includes many other groups: anti-Obama extremists who believe their president is actually a foreign-born Manchurian Candidate seeking to destroy the United States from within; radical alternative-medicine advocates who claim that vaccine makers and mainstream doctors are conspiring to kill large swathes of humanity; financial neo-populists who have adapted the angry message of their nineteenth-century forebears to the age of Twitter; Holocaust deniers; fluoride phobics; obsessive Islamophobes; and more.\n\nMay 2011\nPublisher: HarperCollins Publishers\nFormat: Hardcover 368pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a19b9a1c572c50e8fc3e2c5800fb84e316c18cb","amp;dn":"Among+the+Truthers%3A+America%5C%27s+Growing+Conspiracist+Underground","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a19b9a1c572c50e8fc3e2c5800fb84e316c18cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,25,185,161,197,114,197,14,143,195,226,197,128,15,184,78,49,108,24,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
