In the Year of the City 2274, humans forsake the ravaged outer environment by living in a vast, bubbled metropolis.  There, computerized servo-mechanisms provide all the needs and everyone can pursue endless hedonism.  Endless, that is, until Last Day.  That's when anyone who's 30 must submit to Carrousel, a soaring, spinning trip to eternity and supposed rebirth.\n\nThe screen's first use of laser holography provides some of the sci-fi kicks in this post-apocalyptic saga honored with a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects.  Michael York plays Logan 5, a government Sandman authorized to terminate Runners fleeing Carrousel.  Logan is almost 30.  Catch him if you can.\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\nfull screen version\n\nPlease do not hit and run.  Seed so others may enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c01d45d6d78cff2c5326e71783291262b8b2d30","amp;dn":"Logans+Run+%281976%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c01d45d6d78cff2c5326e71783291262b8b2d30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,1,212,93,109,120,207,242,197,50,110,113,120,50,145,38,43,139,45,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
