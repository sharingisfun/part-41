So we felt that there could be no better 19th Century theatrical auditorium in London for this occasion than the Royal Albert Hall. With its Victorian red plush and celebrated magnificent organ it is the perfect place for The Phantom to haunt. Though this special staging will naturally be drawn from the brilliant original, it will be both a spectacular and unique production with a cast and orchestra of over 200 headed by Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess. Both artists have been an outstanding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PhantomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ChristineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in recent productions and have also enjoyed huge success together as the stars of Love Never Dies.\n\nI have no doubt that these three performances at the Royal Albert Hall will be a thrilling celebration of the Music of the Night.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTHE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA became the longest running show in Broadway history on 9 January 2006 when it celebrated its 7,486th performance, surpassing the previous record holder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCatsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
