Recognized as one of the top record producers in the United States during the late Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s and the 1970s, Simon produced numerous classic albums that continue to sell more than 30 years later, including The BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Music from Big PinkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The BandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Last WaltzÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cheap ThrillsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company featuring Janis Joplin, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BookendsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Songs of Leonard CohenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Leonard Cohen, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Child Is Father to the ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears.\n\nAfter Princeton, Simon was hired as a trainee at Columbia Records. He was first assigned to the Legacy department under the guidance of Goddard Lieberson, then the president of Columbia. SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work during that period involved Original Cast Albums of Broadway shows and audio documentary albums, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Point of OrderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, an LP of the notorious Senate hearings conducted by rabid anti-Communist, Senator Joseph McCarthy and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Medium Is the MassageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ inspired by the writings of media guru, Marshall McLuhan. In 1966, he arranged and produced Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red Rubber BallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by The Cyrkle. The song, which was co-written by Paul Simon (no relation) of Simon and Garfunkel and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers, went to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.\n\nPaul Simon urged John Simon to follow his muse to be a singer-songwriter in his own right. Consequently, in the early Seventies, he recorded two albums for Warner Brothers, Ã¢â‚¬Å“John SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AlbumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“JourneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f7221b22aee9c8598d08e79b36c62ff14b5f47","amp;dn":"John+Simon+%26lrm%3B-+Journey+%281972%29+MP3%40256","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f7221b22aee9c8598d08e79b36c62ff14b5f47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,247,34,27,34,174,233,200,89,141,8,231,155,54,198,47,241,75,95,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
