The reclusive owner of a successful corporation, she is also hostage to a covert life she neither wanted nor asked for. One that refuses to become a part of her past.\n\nBlackmailed into a return to her deadly role as the Wraith, a frightening entity in the world that lives in the shadows, Bailey decides to break free. She settles in for a brutal game of chess with her former employers, prepared for every eventuality but one -- Piper Tate, her new assistant, who decides that the dark, mysterious Bailey is someone she wants to know better. A lot better.\n\nThe stakes continue to rise, as Piper discovers in Bailey a gentle, innocent heart. A heart that beats within the body of a killer who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be tamed and who is prepared to do whatever it takes to preserve the new world Piper has introduced her to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73bb724dee1deafa919f956f0417a377187cc8ad","amp;dn":"Engravings+of+Wraith+-+Kiera+Dellacroix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73bb724dee1deafa919f956f0417a377187cc8ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,187,114,77,238,29,234,250,145,159,149,111,4,23,163,119,24,124,200,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
