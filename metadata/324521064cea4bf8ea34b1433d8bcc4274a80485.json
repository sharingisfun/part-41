But the man who holds third place has a song in this countdown and has had 7 number one albums in just four years.\n \nCasey tells us about a new singer who calls himself &quot;Meat Loaf.&quot;\n\nA listener writes in with this question, &quot;What number one song in the rock era kept the most number two songs from going all the way to the top?&quot; The song in question held back five number one take-over attempts.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What's the longest span of time between a recording act's first charted single and their first number one?&quot; Casey says it was a burlesque song!\n\nThere is an act in the countdown who recorded the biggest selling hit Great Brittan ever had, but that song never even charted in the US.\n\n40:    Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad - Meat Loaf\n39:    Thank You For Being A Friend- Andrew Gold\n38:    Let's All Chant - The Michael Zager Band        \n37:    Ego - Elton John     \n36:    Do You Believe In Magic - Shaun Cassidy     \n35:    Ebony Eyes - Bob Welch    \n34:    Emotion - Samantha Sang\n33:    More Than A Woman - Tavares\n32:    Fantasy - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n31:    It's A Heartache - Bonnie Tyler\n30:    Baby Hold On - Eddie Money\n29:    Movin' Out - Billy Joel    \n28:    Love Is Like Oxygen - Sweet\n27:    Love Is Thicker Than Water - Andy Gibb\n26:    Werewolves Of London - Warren Zevon\n25:    On Broadway - George Benson\n24:    We'll Never Have To Say Goodbye - England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n23:    Two Doors Down - Dolly Parton\n22:    Shadow Dancing - Andy Gibb\n21:    Goodbye Girl - David Gates\n20:    This Time I'm In It For Love - Player\n19:    Disco Inferno - Trammps\n18:    Our Love - Natalie Cole\n17:    Sweet Talking Woman - Electric Light Orchestra\n16:    Flashlight - Parliament\n15:    Feels So Good - Chuck Mangione\n14:    Imaginary Lover - Atlanta Rhythm Section\n13:    Stayin' Alive - The Bee Gees\n12:    Count On Me - The Jefferson Starship\n11:    Runnin' On Empty - Jackson Browne\n10:    Too Much, Too Little, Too Late - Johnny Mathis &amp; Deniece Williams\n9:    You're The One That I Want - John Travolta &amp; Olivia Newton-John\n8:    Jack &amp; Jill - Raydio\n7:    Dust In The Wind - Kansas\n6:    Lay Down Sally - Eric Clapton\n5:    With A Little Luck - Wings\n4:    The Closer I Get To You - Roberta Flack\n3:    Can't Smile Without You - Barry Manilow\n2:    If I Can't Have You - Yvonne Elliman\n1:    Night Fever - The Bee Gees\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324521064cea4bf8ea34b1433d8bcc4274a80485","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_April_29th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324521064cea4bf8ea34b1433d8bcc4274a80485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,69,33,6,76,234,75,248,234,52,177,67,61,139,204,66,116,168,4,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
