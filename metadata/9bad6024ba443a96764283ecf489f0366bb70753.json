The songs vary from her breathy rendition of &quot;My One and Only Love&quot; to the rousing &quot;Somebody Else's Restaurant&quot; which feels almost like Christine Lavin covering Arlo Guthrie. A longtime guest on A Prairie Home Companion, Schmidt defies definition, ranging from jazz to folk, soul to blues, all with a distinctly contemporary feel\nClaudia Schmidt is a musician who has recorded folk, jazz, blues, and spoken word albums. She plays guitar and Appalachian dulcimer and sings. She has appeared numerous times on the radio program, A Prairie Home Companion. She has recorded with Peter Ostroushko as well as Steve Tibbetts. She also appeared in a documentary film, Gap-Toothed Women, by Les Blank.\n\nClaudia has been a well-known fixture in the folk/acoustic music scene since her earliest days performing in the late seventies. Her first self-titled recording on Flying Fish Records, since bought out by Rounder Records was a huge success. She recorded four solo entrees with this label, and one duo recording with Sally Rogers. In 1987 she started a relationship with the budding record label Redhouse Records where she recorded another five sessions, including one more duo with Sally Rogers. All ten of the above recordings were clearly in the folk/acoustic domain.\n\nIn 2001 she ventured off into independent status with her first full-fledged jazz recording, Live at the Old Rectory Pub. She has since recorded other independent efforts including two jazz CDs, and folk/acoustic CD, and a spoken word CD.\n\nClaudia has also made a name for herself in musical theater around the midwest. She has scored the music for several plays including a Joseph Jefferson Award winning effort for A Good Person of Szechuan mounted by the Goodman Theater in Chicago in 1992.\n\nIn 2006 Claudia recorded the soundtrack for a new documentary Motherhood Manifesto, by John deGraff author of Take Back Your Time. She also starred in a musical telling of the Edmund Fitzgerald tragedy titled The Gales of November. This theater piece tells the tragic story of the sinking of this mighty ore ship from the point of view of the wives of several fated crew members.\n\nClaudia lives in Traverse City, Michigan where she can frequently be found sitting in or headlining local establishments. It is also where she ventures forth continuing her decades long quest of the road","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bad6024ba443a96764283ecf489f0366bb70753","amp;dn":"Claudia+Schmidt+-+Wings+of+Wonder+%5B2000%5D%5BLog%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bad6024ba443a96764283ecf489f0366bb70753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,173,96,36,186,68,58,150,118,66,131,236,244,137,240,54,107,183,7,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
