His job with a travel agency in a mall and a succession of meaningless sexual trysts are unsatisfying and quite boring. In search of a thrill he even begins driving his motorcycle with wild abandon. Nothing seems to help until... Until Christopher finds the one thing that every man needs: complete and utter devotion and acceptance from a woman who will never speak any words that are unwelcome\n\nCast\nChristopher Lambert ...
