In 1967, Peter Green formed Fleetwood Mac with former John Mayall sidemen Mick Fleetwood (drums) and John McVie (bass). The band became the toast of the town, playing a unique blend of the Blues that was influenced by traditional American Blues but injected with new life by the expertise of guitarist Peter Green. As successful as they were, the band eventually splintered with Fleetwood and McVie carrying on the name under numerous transformations until finally achieving commercial success in America during the '70s.\n\nEmerging originally out the mid-60s British blues boom, the band arrived amidst a blaze of glory, in the wake of the Rolling Stones and Cream. Fleetwood Mac were also contemporaries of another blues-steeped outfit, Led Zeppelin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and, like so many acts of the era, their roots lay in the tangled history of the Godfather of the British blues, John Mayall, and his long-running band the Bluesbreakers.\n\nGuitarist Peter Green had replaced Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers, and when Green left to form Fleetwood Mac, he in turn was replaced by another young guitarist, Mick Taylor, who would soon quit to join the Rolling Stones.\n\nFrom the very beginning Fleetwood Mac were blues purists, as can be heard on this compilation, which draws on the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first three albums. They were all blues fans, but Peter Green was particularly drawn to the fiery electric blues of 1950s Southside Chicago, while Jeremy Spencer was a fan of the legendary Elmore James. Back then, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton were widely regarded as the great Ã¢â‚¬Å“guitar heroesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but significantly, it was Peter Green who B.B. King singled out as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the only guitarist in the world who could make me sweat!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPeter Green quit his band at the beginning of the 1970s. But by the decadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, Fleetwood Mac had become the biggest band in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the roots of that phenomenon can be heard on the tracks assembled here.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDISC 1:\n01.
