The papers cover some of the most active areas of research on the frontiers between computation, logic, and linguistics, with particular interest in cross-disciplinary topics. Typical areas of interest are: foundations of computing and programming; novel computation models and paradigms; broad notions of proof and belief; formal methods in software and hardware development; logical approach to natural language and reasoning; logics of programs, actions and resources; foundational aspects of information organization, search, flow, sharing, and protection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:642b338ca14c3ee325cd0a8a6a09516714fd7bef","amp;dn":"Logic%2C+Language%2C+Information+and+Computation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"642b338ca14c3ee325cd0a8a6a09516714fd7bef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,43,51,140,161,76,62,227,37,205,10,138,106,9,81,103,20,253,123,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
