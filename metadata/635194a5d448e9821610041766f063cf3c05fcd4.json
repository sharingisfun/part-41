The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential  plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.\n\nThe game follows the five Simpson family membersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and LisaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, the game's antagonist, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.\n\nVideo game critics gave the game a mixed reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:635194a5d448e9821610041766f063cf3c05fcd4","amp;dn":"The_Simpsons-PAL-PS2DVD-DAGGER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"635194a5d448e9821610041766f063cf3c05fcd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,81,148,165,212,72,233,130,22,16,4,23,102,240,99,207,60,5,252,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
