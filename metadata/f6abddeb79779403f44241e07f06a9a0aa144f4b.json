He just instructed his esteemed colleagues in the Senate to get off their collective behinds and do something about the sequester.\n\nThe Hill quotes Boehner from yesterday:  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have moved a bill in the House twice. We should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Boehner told reporters in a press conference, repeating a message he had just delivered in a closed-door meeting of the House Republican conference.\n\nWhen all else fails, cuss at them, is that the strategy?  Seemed to have worked for Nixon, another infamous Republican.  Good company, John.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6abddeb79779403f44241e07f06a9a0aa144f4b","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy+Show+-+February+26+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6abddeb79779403f44241e07f06a9a0aa144f4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,171,221,235,121,119,148,3,244,66,65,224,127,6,169,160,170,20,79,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
