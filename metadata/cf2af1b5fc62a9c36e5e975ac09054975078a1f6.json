Goodman and Prine were not only close friends, but they also shared a witty, fresh approach to folk music. However, whereas the overwhelming majority of John Prine's songs were self-penned, Steve Goodman's output consisted of a mixture of originals and covers. I would say he was equally strong as a songwriter and an interpreter of others' songs. \n\nAs far as the Goodman originals on this album go, you have Steve's own version of the classic train song made famous by Arlo Guthrie, &quot;City of New Orleans.&quot; I prefer the author's version to Guthrie's hit version. Another great song from Goodman's pen is &quot;Eight Ball Blues,&quot; a catchy, clever tune. &quot;Would You Like to Learn to Dance&quot; and &quot;Yellow Coat&quot; are gentle ballads with nice melodies. My favorite cover on this album is &quot;Jazzman,&quot; and my least favorite--and also the only song I don't care for--is another cover, &quot;So Fine&quot;; it's just really dull.\n\nIf you liked Prine's debut, then check out this one.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/08/stevie-goodman/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/08/stevie-goodman/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf2af1b5fc62a9c36e5e975ac09054975078a1f6","amp;dn":"Steve+Goodman...Steve+Goodman%281972%29remastered%281999%28%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf2af1b5fc62a9c36e5e975ac09054975078a1f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,42,241,181,252,98,169,195,110,94,151,90,192,144,84,151,80,120,161,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
