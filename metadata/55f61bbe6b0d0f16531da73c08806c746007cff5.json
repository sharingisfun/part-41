And while a grassroots movement worldwide continues to grow, and demand answers to the many unanswered questions, the public outcry for accountability and transparency makes this film, perhaps, the most important film of 2006.\n\n&quot;Everybody&amp;#039;s Gotta Learn Sometime&quot; is a free movie, produced by an independent artist, for educational and journalistic purposes only. Any proceeds derived from this premier event will go towards allaying the costs of presenting this film in the light of day, in New York City, in what is left of a free America in Tribeca.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f61bbe6b0d0f16531da73c08806c746007cff5","amp;dn":"911+-+Everybody%5C%27s+Gotta+Learn+Sometime+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f61bbe6b0d0f16531da73c08806c746007cff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,246,27,190,107,13,15,22,83,29,167,60,8,128,108,116,96,7,207,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
