Not this month. I had hoped to open with Lifeforms from Daughter. Music that whispers how we can learn to really love. Its an I3 List now (lower sound quality).\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the playlists are less then other months. In the contrary, all five playlists I2 Rock, I3 Pop / Folk and I5 Electronic, are simply awesome.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\nI2 You Know Me\n\n01 Dress Rehearsal - Light Bright\n02 Grant Lee Buffalo - Jupiter And Teardrop\n03 Bronze Radio Return - Further On\n04 Dispatch - Circles Around The Sun\n05 Air Traffic Controller - You Know Me\n06 Gin Blossoms - Allison Road\n07 Morrissey - Have-A-Go Merchant\n08 Joy Rider - That Tired\n09 Biffy Clyro - Mountains\n10 Matchbox Twenty - She's So Mean\n11 Two Door Cinema Club - What You Know\n12 All Mankind &amp; All Mankind &amp; All Mankind - Break The Spell\n13 The Dykeenies - Things You Cannot See\n14 Wild Party - Outright\n15 For The Foxes - We're Coming Up\n16 Painted Palms - Click\n17 Swear &amp; Shake - These White Walls\n18 Makthaverskan - Asleep\n19 Limp Bizkit - Angels\n20 Nada Surf - Enjoy The Silence\n21 Komeda - It's Alright, Baby\n22 Ex Cops - James\n23 They Might Be Giants - Call You Mom\n24 San Cisco - Fred Astaire\n25 Red Hot Chily Peppers - Did I Let You Know\n26 Kilians - Fight The Start\n27 The Kooks - Always Where I Need To Be\n28 Set Sail - Kids\n29 The 1975 - Chocolate\n30 Widowspeak - Perennials\n\nI3 Go Slow\n\n01 Biffy Clyro - Know Your Quarry\n02 Dinosaur Jr. - Take A Run At The Sun\n03 Haim - Go Slow\n04 Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds - Jubilee Street\n05 Inspired &amp; The Sleep - Sink\n06 The Head &amp; The Heart - Cats And Dogs\n07 Bells Atlas - Video Star\n08 Frank Turner - I Knew Prufrock Before He Got Famous\n09 Sarah Humphreys - Like A House Needs A Door\n10 Yast - Heart Of Steel\n11 Youth Group - Baby Body\n12 Limp Bizkit - Walking Away\n13 Bad Cello - Not That I've Changed\n14 Hey Marseilles - Bright Stars Burning\n15 Half Moon Run - Call Me In The Afternoon\n16 Squeeze - Cold Shoulder\n17 Sean Rowe - Joe's Cult\n18 The Virginmarys - Dressed To Kill\n19 Alt-J - Dissolve Me\n20 Dear Reader - Down Under, Mining\n21 Thylacine (Ft.
