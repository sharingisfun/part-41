After years of living beyond our means the country surely needs to wean itself off the consumer society, but doing so threatens our retail dependent economy. In Germany the model of thrift and investment, far from the quick buck mentality of the City of London, has produced a powerful manufacturing and exporting economy that Britain, once so proud of its modern finance based approach, is desperate to imitate.\n\nIt is a long road to rebalancing the British model and with the Eurozone crisis still threatening further financial armageddon, Peston asks whether we are in for decades, rather than years, of sluggish growth. Featuring interviews with senior economists, bankers and politicians, as well as the ordinary people in several countries, whose livelihoods depend on the outcome of this vast economic reordering of the world.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 1280*720\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e010eadbb30bddd3f05eed65b1180e2297fa1b1","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+The+Party%5C%27s+Over_+How+the+West+Went+Bust+2+of+2+x264+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e010eadbb30bddd3f05eed65b1180e2297fa1b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,1,14,173,187,48,189,221,63,5,238,214,91,17,128,226,41,127,161,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
