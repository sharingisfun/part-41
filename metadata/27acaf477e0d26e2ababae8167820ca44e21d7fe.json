Recorded live in Philadelphia and Fortworth during the summer '72 US Tour. Never released, apparantly due to legal reasons. Legend has it these versions of the recordings were first broadcast on either Radio Luxembourg or WMMS Cleveland, but a more believable story is that 2 cassettes were sold backstage during the 1975 tour by a Stones associate.  (Apparently thecassettes were then played over the radio in Cleveland.)  These are fine raw recordings that have not been properly mixed in the studio. Theres another bootleg of the same album, tho that one is shorter, studiomixed and err..in mono (!). This is a better recording  as far as Im concerned. Soundboard source so the quality of the sound is very fine imho. One of their very best liveperformances ever.\n\n\n192kbs\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\tPhiladelphia, PA, July 21st, 1972, 1st show\t\n  \t1. \t4:20  \t All Down The Line \t \t\n  \t2. \t3:34  \t Brown Sugar \t \t\n  \t3. \t4:10  \t Bitch \t \t\n  \t4. \t3:54  \t Rocks Off \t \t\n  \t5. \t5:52  \t Gimme Shelter \t \t\n  \t6. \t3:54  \t Happy \t \t\n  \t7. \t4:49  \t Tumbling Dice \t \n  \tFort Worth, TX, June 24th, 1972, 1st show\t\n  \t8. \t6:11  \t Love In Vain \t \t\n  \t9. \t4:44  \t Sweet Virginia \t \t\n  \t10. \t7:45  \t You Can't Always Get What You Want \t \t\n  \t11. \t11:13    Midnight Rambler \t  (2nd show)\t\n  \t12. \t2:16  \t Rip This Joint \t \t\n  \t13. \t3:20  \t Jumping Jack Flash \t\n\n\n\tEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27acaf477e0d26e2ababae8167820ca44e21d7fe","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Unreleased+Decca+Live+Album+1972","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27acaf477e0d26e2ababae8167820ca44e21d7fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,172,175,71,126,13,38,226,171,171,174,129,103,130,12,164,78,33,215,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
