It uses vibrant personal stories and ethnographic examples to connect developments among the Gebusi of Papua New Guinea to key topics in cultural anthropology, including comparative features of subsistence, kinship, politics, religion, gender, ethnicity, nationalism, and modern development. In the early 1980s, the Gebusi conducted ritual dances and spirit seances, practiced alternative sexual customs, and endured high rate of violence. By 1998, most Gebusi had converted to Christianity and were actively engaged in market activity, disco music, sports leagues, and school. In 2008, however, public services and the cash economy had deteriorated, and people relied increasingly on their traditional customs and practices. \n\nThis second edition of The Gebusi vividly portrays both the traditions and the modern challenges of Gebusi society and culture with updated content throughout and surprising new conclusions based on the author's return to the Gebusi in 2008.\t\n\n--------\n\nFile Contents:\n\nThe Gebusi_ Lives Transformed in a Rainforest World - Knauft, Bruce.azw4\n\n----\n\nKindle formatted\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd9d36a2b829c95eebaa8e174147044bf8944660","amp;dn":"The+Gebusi+Lives+Transformed+in+a+Rainforest+World+azw4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd9d36a2b829c95eebaa8e174147044bf8944660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,157,54,162,184,41,201,94,235,170,142,23,65,71,4,75,248,148,70,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
