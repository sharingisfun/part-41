In some ways, the group is like an Americana version of Los Lobos, but the Pistoleros have a stronger classic rock and power-pop bent, which makes their music muscular and powerful. They're also talented songwriters who have excellent taste in collaborators. Gary Louris and Marc Perlamn of the Jayhawks co-wrote &quot;Hang on to Nothing&quot; and &quot;Wasting My Time,&quot; while the Smithereens' Pat DiNizio co-wrote &quot;Somehow Someway,&quot; &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot; and &quot;The Game.&quot; The first single, &quot;Hang on to Nothing,&quot; is a Douglas Hopkins composition, and like &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot; and &quot;Found Out About You,&quot; the two hits he wrote for the Gin Blossoms, it kicks with a rootsy spirit and irresistible melody, and it's just the icing on this excellent debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64cf58cacc52bc70406429d60d3c1781c06b0673","amp;dn":"The+Pistoleros+-+Hang+On+To+Nothing+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64cf58cacc52bc70406429d60d3c1781c06b0673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,207,88,202,204,82,188,112,64,100,41,214,13,60,23,129,192,107,6,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
