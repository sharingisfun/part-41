It forms a comprehensive but accessible reference for all professionals and students interested in roads, road transport and the wide range of disciplines involved with roads.\n\nInternational in scope, it begins with the preliminary construction procedures; from road planning policies and design considerations to the selection of materials and the building of roads and bridges. It then explores road operating environments that include driver behaviour, traffic flow, lighting and maintenance, and assesses the cost, economics, transport implications and environmental impact of road use.\n\nIt draws on Max LayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unparalleled consulting and operational experience in the financing, planning, design, construction, operation and management of roads in various countries. It forms an indispensable resource for transport planning, engineering, operations and economics.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/612vPCdOiBL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/612vPCdOiBL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nM.
