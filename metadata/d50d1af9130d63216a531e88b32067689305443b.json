The song includes lead vocals from Ronan Keating and Stephen Gately. After Gately's death, Mika allowed the song to be released as a tribute to the singer. He said: &quot;I was shocked and saddened when to hear about Stephen's passing. He touched so many people's lives both with his music and with his wonderful personality. It's an honour to hear him sing my song. I wish all the best to the rest of the boys.
