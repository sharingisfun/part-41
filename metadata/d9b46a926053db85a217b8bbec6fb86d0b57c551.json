NeuFutur Magazine dealt about LGBT politics, music, pop culture, and DIY projects like building an electric bike, creating your own magazine, and even how to successfully establish a record label.\n\nNeuFutur #9's pieces included a listing of failed soda pops, humorous aphorisms, discussions on transgender identity, and reviewed a number of independent magazines and music.\n\nIf there is enough demand for it, I can upload scans of each individual page and/or other issues. NeuFutur is still actively being published, and resides online at http://www.neufutur.com .\n\nLook for NeuFutur's Summer 2010 issue late in July, which ties together articles by the husband and wife combo along with a wide array of the most talented writers that Northern Ohio has to offer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b46a926053db85a217b8bbec6fb86d0b57c551","amp;dn":"NeuFutur9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b46a926053db85a217b8bbec6fb86d0b57c551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,180,106,146,96,83,219,133,162,23,184,187,236,111,184,109,11,87,197,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
