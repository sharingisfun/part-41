The black screen may still appear on those mahines that have a dual core processor without hyperthreading , as an temporary fix, I've included extreme injector in this torrent. Use it only if u face any black screen issue otherwise game should run fine without it. It's located in 'Dual core fix' folder, open 'Readme' textfile and the 'Instructions' photo present in it to use injector ....\n\nIf you are still unable to get it working, feel free to drop a private message on my facebook page.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE REPACK,, GIVE FEEDBACK AND SEED.......\n\nLIKE THE GAME,, BUY IT AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS.......\n\nCheck out my Official facebook page for any help :\n'Mr DJ repacks'\nLike it guys to support and get updates on upcoming repacks, gaming tips and requests","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681f2e5dc2acca9735ebffc60016472a7f810543","amp;dn":"Far+Cry+4+Gold+Edition+ver+1.4+%5B4xDVD5%5D+Multi+15+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681f2e5dc2acca9735ebffc60016472a7f810543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,31,46,93,194,172,202,151,53,235,255,198,0,22,71,42,127,129,5,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
