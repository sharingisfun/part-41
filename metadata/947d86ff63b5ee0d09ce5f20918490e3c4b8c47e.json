Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Hi Infidelity (1980) contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group's best-selling album, with over ten million copies sold.\n\nOver the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits, including the number ones &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; and &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot;. REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity dissipated in the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR.E.O. Speedwagon was the debut album by American rock band REO Speedwagon. Released in 1971, it was the only album recorded with singer Terry Luttrell until Kevin Cronin joined the band for R.E.O./T.W.O. This album had more of a progressive rock sound than later stadium rock/adult contemporary works that made them famous.\n\nThe album produced the fan favorites Ã¢â‚¬Å“157 Riverside AvenueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sophisticated LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lay Me DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but sold very poorly, though Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sophisticated LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ did reach number 122 on the singles charts. Ã¢â‚¬Å“157 Riverside AvenueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lay Me DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were subsequently recorded on the live album Live: You Get What You Play For. Ã¢â‚¬Å“157 Riverside AvenueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sophisticated LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were both featured on the compilation album A Decade of Rock and Roll: 1970-1980. \n\nIn 2007, the British company BGO Records released REO Speedwagon and R.E.O./T.W.O. together (BGOCD775), marking the first time the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album was widely available in CD format. For some unknown reason, Epic Records never issued this first album on the cassette tape format.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nR.E.O./T.W.O. is the second LP released by the Illinois-based rock band REO Speedwagon. Under the leadership of guitarist Gary Richrath, this album continued the musical direction set on 1971's REO Speedwagon with Richrath's own classic compositions carrying the record.\n\nR.E.O./T.W.O launched REO on its first national tour and presented a more polished production than the bandÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs debut album; however it still retained the progressive rock leanings that they were to ditch following the arrival of Mike Murphy and did not even have a slightly successful single to rival Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sophisticated LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Despite this and R.E.O./T.W.O.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s failure to dent the Billboard Top 200, it has remained more readily available than the debut.\n\nThe album introduced Kevin Cronin as vocalist and contributing song writer to the band, replacing Terry Luttrell. Highlights of the album include RichrathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Golden CountryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a compelling political statement with possibly his finest guitar solo as well as &quot;Like You Do&quot;. Both songs, as well as CroninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Music ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, are frequently part of the band's current setlist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:947d86ff63b5ee0d09ce5f20918490e3c4b8c47e","amp;dn":"REO+Speedwagon%2FTWO+%5B1971%2C1972%5D%5B2007%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"947d86ff63b5ee0d09ce5f20918490e3c4b8c47e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,125,134,255,99,181,238,13,9,206,95,32,145,132,144,227,196,184,196,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
