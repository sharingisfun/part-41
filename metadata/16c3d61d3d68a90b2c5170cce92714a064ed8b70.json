You can see the info here about the fuss it caused\n\nhttpsnardfarker.ning.comprofilesblogswikileaks-to-reveal-pentagon\n\nThe video comprises good quality aerial AV footage from a helicopter gunship surgically exterminating human beings in what appears to be a residential area of Baghdad. While some may well be 'terrorists', others are clearly civilians - but no-one seems to care too much any more.\n\nAt about 8 mins in, some guys are trying to help an injured man into a van. They succeed - only to be wiped out by Uncle Sam anyway.\n\nI'm not defending either side as such. I'm just wondering if it might be time to try to find another way to bring this to an end\n\nI'm so tired of being ashamed of my country and it's allies. Is it really necessary that we inflict so much pain upon so many for so long What's in it for you and me eh\n\nSupport the General Strike, April 15th-19th.\n\nDirect download (while it lasts)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c3d61d3d68a90b2c5170cce92714a064ed8b70","amp;dn":"Wikileaks+leaked+video+of+Civilians+killed+in+Baghdad+-+FULL+VER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c3d61d3d68a90b2c5170cce92714a064ed8b70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,195,214,29,61,104,169,11,44,81,112,204,233,39,20,160,100,237,139,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
