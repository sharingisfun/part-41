I did).  It was developed by an LDS member in his own free\ntime, and it's superior to most handheld readers out there. Even the PC desktop\nversion is fantastic. \n\nI've included the following in this release:\n- Yanceyware software and tools: \n\tYanCEyWare Reader.exe -- this is the PocketPC software installation for \n\t\tWindowsPPC2002 or higher.  \n\tPocketPC cab files -- these can be copied to your device and installed \n\t\tdirectly on your device.  Two different files are included: \n\t\tWindowsPPC2002 and higher\n\t\tWindows Mobile 5 and higher\n\tYanCEyDesktop 1.40.0855.exe -- Yancey Reader for Windows OS (requires\n\t\tthe installation of dotnet2.0 or higher)\n\tYanceyLink -- Allows you to convert ebooks from GospeLink 2001 to \n\t\tYancey ebook (ybk) format.  \n\tXPresso_0.2[20].exe -- Allows you to convert any html document into \n\t\tYancey ebook (ybk) format. \n\n- GospeLink collection -- I used the Yanceylink tool to convert the entire \n\tGospeLink 2001 library and included all 1500+ ebooks here (minus \n\tperiodicals, such as the Ensign, New Era, Friend, Liahona, etc. -- it \n\tcrashed everytime I tried to to convert these).\n\n- Sorted Libraries -- These ebooks are sorted into different folders by subject,\n\tthus you can select each relevant library, instead of having to sift \n\tthrough a single massive library list of hundreds of ebook titles on \n\tyour PocketPC.\n\nMay the Lord bless you and lead you in your Gospel research.  Please make good \nuse of these tools to honor our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07658477fda4dca944eeafcce171531a3a9e2915","amp;dn":"Yanceyware+collection+-+LDS+Mormon+ebooks+-+Windows%2C+Pocket+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07658477fda4dca944eeafcce171531a3a9e2915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,101,132,119,253,164,220,169,68,238,175,204,225,113,83,26,58,158,41,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
