Widely regarded as the greatest writer of Brazilian literature, nevertheless he did not gain widespread popularity outside Brazil in his own lifetime. He was multilingual, having taught himself French, English, German and Greek in later life.\n\nMachado's works had a great influence on Brazilian literary schools of the late 19th century and early 20th centuries. JosÃƒÂ© Saramago, Carlos Fuentes, Woody Allen and Susan Sontag are among his admirers.\n\nMachado's style is unique, and several literary critics have tried to describe it since 1897. He is considered by many the greatest Brazilian writer of all time, and one of the world's greatest novelists and short story writers. His chronicles do not share the same status. His poems are often misunderstood for the use of crude terms, sometimes associated to the style of Augusto dos Anjos, another Brazilian writer. Machado de Assis was included on American literary critic Harold Bloom's list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature, alongside writers such as Dante, Shakespeare and Cervantes. Bloom considers him the greatest black writer in Western literature, but his classification of him as black is based on United States's conceptions of race. These are not the same in Brazil.\n\nCritics are divided as to the nature of Machado de Assis's writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, classify Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado's work as a faithful description of Brazilian realityÃ¢â‚¬â€but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of MachadoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own statements, Daniel argues that MachadoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, MachadoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier novels have more in common with a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Romantic Realism.&quot; In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado's prose constitutes an exposÃƒÂ© of the social, political and economic dysfunction of Second Empire Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado's innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil. Schwarz, a Marxist, argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.\n\nMachado's literary style has inspired many Brazilian writers. His works have been adapted to television, theater and cinema. In 1975 the ComissÃƒÂ£o Machado de Assis (&quot;Machado de Assis Commission&quot;), organized by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, organized and published critical editions of Machado's works, in 15 volumes. His main works have been translated into many languages. Great 20th-century writers such as Salman Rushdie, Cabrera Infante and Carlos Fuentes, as well as the American film director Woody Allen, have expressed their enthusiasm for his fiction. Despite the efforts and patronage of such well-known intellectuals as Susan Sontag, Harold Bloom, and Elizabeth Hardwick, Machado's booksÃ¢â‚¬â€the most famous of which are available in English in multiple translationsÃ¢â‚¬â€have never achieved large sales in the English-speaking world and he continues to be relatively unknown, even in comparison with other Latin American writers.\n\nIn his works, Machado appeals directly to the reader, breaking the so-called fourth wall.\n\n\nThe torrent contains the following books in ePUB format:\n\n* 1899 - Dom Casmurro\n\n* 1891 - Quincas Borba \n\n* 1881 - The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas\n\n\n\nRead the following articles and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEDDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Maria_Machado_de_Assis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquim_Maria_Machado_de_Assis&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/mar/01/survey-short-story-machado&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/mar/01/survey-short-story-machado&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde3ec7cef3b2e0b17877a248b2fcf601844a384","amp;dn":"Machado+de+Assis+-++Brazilian+Author+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde3ec7cef3b2e0b17877a248b2fcf601844a384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,227,236,124,239,59,46,11,23,135,122,36,139,47,207,96,24,68,163,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
