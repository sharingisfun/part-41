It argues that the events that occurred during this time can be demystified, that the South East of Europe was not destined to become violent and that constructions of the Balkans as endemically violent misses a important political point and historical point.\nCarmichael provides an account of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans as a single historical phenomenon and brings together a vast array of primary and secondary sources to produce a concise and accessible argument. This book will be of interest to students and researchers of European studies, history and comparative politics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6feea2c03aa824bf224e339120a6e7b3b2c6a653","amp;dn":"Ethnic+Cleansing+in+the+Balkans%3A+Nationalism+and+the+Destruction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6feea2c03aa824bf224e339120a6e7b3b2c6a653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,238,162,192,58,168,36,191,34,78,51,145,32,166,231,179,178,198,166,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
