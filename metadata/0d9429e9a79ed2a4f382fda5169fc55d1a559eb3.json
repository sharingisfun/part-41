Fans of The Thin Blue Line, in which Atkinson plays a British policeman, will be pleased, but Mr. Bean enthusiasts will be ecstatic with the handful of great Bean moments re-created for a live audience. A real treat for the Atkinson faithful. \n\n3.67 Gb ( 3Ã‚Â 852Ã‚Â 612 KBytes )\nRussian (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nEnglish (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nPAL 4:3 (720x576) VBR\nTime 01:04:52","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9429e9a79ed2a4f382fda5169fc55d1a559eb3","amp;dn":"Rowan+Atkinson+Live%21+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d9429e9a79ed2a4f382fda5169fc55d1a559eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,148,41,233,167,158,210,164,243,130,253,165,22,159,197,93,26,85,158,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
