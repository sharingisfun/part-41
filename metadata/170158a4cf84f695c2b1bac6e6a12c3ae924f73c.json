These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, to output to a t.v. or such, then this may be for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch LCD/surround sound system.\n\n*** NOTE *** The rest of the series (sans season 10 until the dvd's come out) are all ripped/encoded and ready to go as each torrent gets enough seeders.\n\n------------------------\nSMALLVILLE - SEASON 7\n------------------------\nEpisodes 1-20\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nAverage file size: 525mb\n\nContainer: MKV\nVideo: x264\nResolution: 720 x 480 (16:9 widescreen) (Loose Anamorphic 853 x 480) \n\nAudio: English, 5.1 Channel AC3\n\nSubtitles: English subrip srt in MKV.
