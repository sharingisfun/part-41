The author describes in detail two of the many battles the Mughals fought and depicts the everyday life of the six rulers and the people, saying that his objective is &quot;to portray life rather than merely to chronicle history.&quot; Eraly discusses the camp followers, civilians fleeing the approaching armies, and soldiers suffering from thirst and hunger as they cross deserts and snowbound mountain passes. He tells of elephants and beautiful women exchanged as spoils of war and recounts the rulers' taste in clothes, perfume, liquor, wine, tobacco, opium, and concubines. This account of the Mughal conquest of India is essential in understanding that period of history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c2501ac35b8b59d5267aa72214e02daa91e426c","amp;dn":"The+Mughal+Throne.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c2501ac35b8b59d5267aa72214e02daa91e426c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,37,1,172,53,184,181,157,82,103,170,114,33,78,2,218,169,30,66,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
