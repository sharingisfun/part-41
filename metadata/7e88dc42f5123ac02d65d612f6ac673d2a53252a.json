Greatness doesn't come from DNA but from practice and perseverance honed over decades.\n\nAnd not just plain old hard work, like your grandmother might have advocated, but a very specific kind of work. The key is how you practice, how you analyze the results of your progress and learn from your mistakes, that enables you to achieve greatness.\n\nNow Colvin has expanded his article with much more scientific background and real-world examples. He shows that the skills of business - negotiating deals, evaluating financial statements, and all the rest - obey the principles that lead to greatness, so that anyone can get better at them with the right kind of effort. Even the hardest decisions and interactions can be systematically improved.\n\nThis new mind-set, combined with Colvin's practical advice, will change the way you think about your job and career - and will inspire you to achieve more in all you do. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e88dc42f5123ac02d65d612f6ac673d2a53252a","amp;dn":"Talent+is+Overrated+-+Geoff+Colvin+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e88dc42f5123ac02d65d612f6ac673d2a53252a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,136,220,66,245,18,58,192,45,101,214,18,246,172,103,61,42,83,37,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
