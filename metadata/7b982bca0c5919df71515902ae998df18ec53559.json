Masschelein, Rip G. Rice (CRC, 2002).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 1-56670-603-3\r\n\r\nSeveral general books are available on ultraviolet light and its applications. However, this is the first comprehensive monograph that deals with its application to water and wastewater treatment. There is a rapidly growing interest in using UV light in water sanitation due to the increased knowledge of the potential health and environmental impacts of disinfection byproducts.\r\n\r\nUltraviolet Light in Water and Wastewater Sanitation integrates the fundamental physics applicable to water and wastewater sanitation, the engineering aspects, and the practical experience in the field. The text analyzes the concerns associated with this application of UV light and brings together comprehensive information on the presently available UV technologies applicable to water and wastewater treatment including: lamp technologies, criteria of evaluation and choice of technology; fundamental principles; performance criteria for disinfection; design criteria and methods; synergistic use of UV and oxidants (advanced oxidation); and functional requirements and potential advantages and drawbacks of the technique.\r\n\r\nUltraviolet Light in Water and Wastewater Sanitation is the only treatise currently available combining fundamental knowledge, recommendations for design, evaluations of performance, and future prospects for this application. Water and wastewater treatment professionals, water utility employees, governmental regulators, and chemists will find this book an essential and unique reference for a technology which has received growing regulatory acceptance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b982bca0c5919df71515902ae998df18ec53559","amp;dn":"Ultraviolet+Light+in+Water+and+Wastewater+Sanitation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b982bca0c5919df71515902ae998df18ec53559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,152,43,202,12,89,25,223,113,81,89,2,174,153,141,241,142,197,53,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
