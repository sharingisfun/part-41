The majority of songs follow the same soaring alternative pop formula as the show's opening theme (and the disc's closer), Paula Cole's hit &quot;I Don't Want to Wait&quot; -- in fact, Heather Nova's &quot;London Rain (Nothing Heals Me Like You Do),&quot; Sixpence None the Richer's &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and Sophie B. Hawkins' &quot;Lose Your Way&quot; are all virtually carbon copies, but each is successful in evoking the melodrama which keeps millions of us tuned in week after week.
