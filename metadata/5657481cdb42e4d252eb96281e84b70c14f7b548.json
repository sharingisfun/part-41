Written for undergraduate  students with little or no\nprior knowledge  of game  theory. This book  supports any  game theory\nmodule  on an  economics degree  or indeed  any course  that addresses\nstrategic problem solving.\n\n \nKEY FEATURES\n============\n\n- Key  concepts and  techniques  are  introduced in  early  chapters,\n  such as  the prisoners' dilemma  and Nash equilibrium.  Analysis is\n  later built up  in a step-by-step way in order  to incorporate more\n  interesting features of the world we live in.\n\n- Using  a wide  range of  examples and  applications the  book covers\n  decision   problems  confronted   by   firms,  employers,   unions,\n  footballers, partygoers, politicians, governments, non-governmental\n  organisations and communities.\n\n- Exercises  and activities are embedded  in the text of  the chapters\n  and  additional problems are included at  the end of each chapter to\n  test understanding.\n\n- Realism  is introduced  into  the  analysis  in a  sequential  way,\n  enabling  you to  build  on your  knowledge  and understanding  and\n  appreciate the potential uses of the theory.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nFiona Carmichael is Senior Lecturer  in Economics at the University of\nSalford. She  has a  wealth of experience  in helping  students tackle\nthis potentially daunting yet fascinating subject, as recognised by an\nLTSN award for 'Outstanding Teaching' on her innovative course in game\ntheory.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5657481cdb42e4d252eb96281e84b70c14f7b548","amp;dn":"Guide+to+Game+Theory+-+Fiona+Carmichel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5657481cdb42e4d252eb96281e84b70c14f7b548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,87,72,28,219,66,228,210,82,235,150,40,30,132,183,12,20,247,181,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
