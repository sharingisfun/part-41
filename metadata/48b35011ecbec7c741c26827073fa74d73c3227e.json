Then there's the melodic top 40 single, Girl of My Dreams, with it's clever (and slightly creepy, come to think of it) lyrics about pining after a girl in a magazine. Sarah Smiles, a 60s-infused tune with a really catchy chorus, is another highlight. Turn on the Light provides a proper rave-up ending.\n\nBram Tchaikovsky Formed 1978, United Kingdom, Disbanded 1981  \nMembers: Bram Tchaikovsky [Peter Bramall] (guitar, bass, vocals), Keith Boyce (drums, 1978-80), Mike Broadbent (bass, guitar, vocals, 1978-81), Denis Forbes (guitar, bass, vocals, 1980-81), Keith Line (drums, 1980), Lord Richard Itchingham (bass, 1981), Derek Ballard (drums, 1981) \n\nRelated Artists The Motors, Heavy Metal Kids, Heroes, Nick Garvey \n\n\nA1 Robber  3:06 \nA2 Strange Man, Changed Man  4:05 \nA3 Lonely Dancer  3:54 \nA4 I'm the One That's Leaving  3:27 \nA5 Girl of My Dreams  4:10 \nB1 Bloodline  3:48 \nB2 Nobody Knows  4:32 \nB3 Lady From the USA  3:28 \nB4 I'm a Believer  3:46 \nB5 Sarah Smiles  3:37 \nB6 Turn On the Light  2:49 \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b35011ecbec7c741c26827073fa74d73c3227e","amp;dn":"Bram+Tchaikovsky+-+Strange+Man%2C+Changed+Man+%281979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48b35011ecbec7c741c26827073fa74d73c3227e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,179,80,17,236,190,199,199,65,194,104,39,7,63,167,77,115,195,34,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
