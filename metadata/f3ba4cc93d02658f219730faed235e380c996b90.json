After living in Edmonton, Alberta for a number of years, he currently resides in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nThis record is rooted in a blend of outlaw country, Americana, and folk, but venturing into experimental and avant garde pastures. It may not be quite on the same level as his best country and experimental albums (1997ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s Devotion &amp; Doubt and 2002ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s Impasse), but Our Blood offers a glimpse into the world of Richard Buckner that serves as an ideal starting point for new listeners.\n\n- - -\n\nRichard Buckner - Our Blood 2011\n(London  Decor Records)\n\n 1.
