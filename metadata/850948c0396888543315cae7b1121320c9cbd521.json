What follows is a touching and comical adventure dealing with friendship, heroism and love.\n\n\n\n***I know the film is not available outside the DVD Region 2 area, but that needn't stop us from going to amazon.co.uk and buying the DVD, even if we can't watch it on our current DVD players. Please consider it; think of all the nice new suits Benedict could buy with our cash! Plus, the quality of this is less than perfect. It has had a hard life, ripped and uploaded and downloaded and spliced and uploaded again. All the more reason to buy the DVD!\n\n\nBIG BIG thanks to Danielle (http://danflan.tumblr.com), who was the one to actually rip the DVD and get it out in the open. I'm just the idiot who spent the day yelling at my computer until I managed to trick it into doing the things I needed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:850948c0396888543315cae7b1121320c9cbd521","amp;dn":"Third+Star+film+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"850948c0396888543315cae7b1121320c9cbd521","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,9,72,192,57,104,136,84,51,21,202,231,177,18,19,32,201,203,213,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
