A seven-time Grammy Award winner, he is the only vocalist in history to win in three separate categories: jazz, pop, and R&amp;B. He won the aforementioned Grammys within a span of four consecutive decades ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the '70s, '80s, '90s and '00s.\n\nOne of Jarreau's most commercially and artistically successful albums is Breakin' Away (1981), which includes the hit song &quot;We're in This Love Together.&quot; He wrote and performed the Grammy-nominated theme to the 1980s American television show Moonlighting. Among other things, he is well-known for his scat singing and the ability to imitate conventional guitar, bass and percussive instrumentation. He was also a featured vocalist on USA for Africa's &quot;We Are the World&quot; in which he sang the line, &quot;...and so we all must lend a helping hand.&quot; Another charitable media event, HBO's Comic Relief, featured Al in a duet with Natalie Cole singing the song &quot;Mr. President,&quot; written by Joe Sterling, Mike Loveless and Ray Reach.\n\nAl Jarreau's unique vocal style is one of the world's most precious treasures. His innovative musical expressions have made him one of the most exciting and critically acclaimed performers of our time with seven Grammy Awards, scores of international music awards and popular accolades worldwide. A heart-melting crooner who singed with Reprise in 1975, Jarreau remains the master of the ballad. The only artist to ever win Grammy awards in pop, jazz and R&amp;B, Jarreau handpicks his favorite romantic tunes for LOVE SONGS. \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08f7c4a726efed2925df01503a664e098db5cbbf","amp;dn":"Al+Jarreau+-+After+All","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08f7c4a726efed2925df01503a664e098db5cbbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,247,196,167,38,239,237,41,37,223,1,80,58,102,78,9,141,181,203,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
