His books have been published in countries across the globe and the film rights to the Children of Paranoia trilogy have been optioned by CBS Films. Trevor lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two sons.\n\nGenre: Thriller\n\nChildren of Paranoia: Since the age of eighteen, Joseph has been assassinating people on behalf of a cause that he believes in but doesn't fully understand. The War is ageless, hidden in the shadows, governed by a rigid set of rules, and fought by two distinct sides-one good, one evil. The only unknown is which side is which. Soldiers in the War hide in plain sight, their deeds disguised as accidents or random acts of violence amidst an unsuspecting population ignorant of the brutality that is always inches away.\n\nKilling people is the only life Joseph has ever known, and he's one of the best at it. But when a job goes wrong and he's sent away to complete a punishingly dangerous assignment, Joseph meets a girl named Maria, and for the first time in his life his singleminded, bloody purpose fades away.\n\nBefore Maria, Joseph's only responsibility was dealing death to the anonymous targets fingered by his superiors. Now he must run from the people who have fought by his side to save what he loves most in this world. As Children of Paranoia reaches its heart-in-throat climax, Joseph will learn that only one rule remains immutable: the only thing more dangerous than fighting the War... is leaving it.\n\nChildren of the Underground: The war had been raging for as long as anyone could remember. The secret, endless war between two opposing sides - one good, one evil. Neither side knows which is which; it is kill or be killed in an invisible conflict where assassination is the weapon of choice.\n\nWhen she was just seventeen, Maria was pulled into this secret war and they killed her lover and stole her child. Now they are telling her to go home. To ignore what she knows is going on in the shadows all around her. They told Maria to forget all she'd lost. The trouble is, some things simply can't be forgotten.\n\nNow, with a loose-cannon killer at her side, Maria is going to do whatever it takes to get back what belongs to her. And that means starting a war of her own...\n\nChildren of the Uprising: Over generations, the War has grown. It has become bloodier. Both sides will do anything to win. But with the involvement of a third factionÃ¢â‚¬â€one that wants to put an end to the violence finallyÃ¢â‚¬â€even more enemies lurk around every corner.\n\nStrangers have been watching Christopher for his entire life. He doesn't know why, but he knows that he has paranoia in his blood. He has prepared since he was young for the day that they would stop watching and come for him. On his eighteenth birthday, Christopher is attacked. Though he escapes with his life, he finds himself thrust into a War he never knew existed.\n\nTo the people of the War, Christopher is a legend, the hero or the villain who may one day bring an end to the conflict. But Christopher knows only that he isn't willing to become anyone's pawn....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f80f58090f11eee17a1f7c26f6fc76c3e6c1b38","amp;dn":"Children+of+Paranoia+series+by+Trevor+Shane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f80f58090f11eee17a1f7c26f6fc76c3e6c1b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,128,245,128,144,241,30,238,23,161,247,194,111,111,199,108,62,108,27,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
