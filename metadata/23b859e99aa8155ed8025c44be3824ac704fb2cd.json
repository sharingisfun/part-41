They were specifically located at Khirbet Qumran in the British Mandate for Palestine, in what is now known as the West Bank.\n\n\nThe texts are of great religious and historical significance, as they include the oldest known surviving copies of Biblical and extra-biblical documents and preserve evidence of great diversity in late Second Temple Judaism. They are written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, mostly on parchment, but with some written on papyrus.These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE and 70 CE.\n\n\nThe scrolls are traditionally identified with the ancient Jewish sect called the Essenes, though some recent interpretations have challenged this association and argue that the scrolls were penned by priests in Jerusalem, Zadokites, or other unknown Jewish groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  &quot; The Sons of Righteousness shall shine to &quot;\n                    all ends of the world,continuing to shine\n                      forth until the end of the appointed\n                            &quot;seasons of darkness.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Dominic Frisby\n===========================\n\n\nProduced by: Steve Baker\n========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Truth Behind The Dead Sea Scrolls\nYear.................:    2006\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:45:32\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    256 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2480 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    807 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2006\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b859e99aa8155ed8025c44be3824ac704fb2cd","amp;dn":"The+Truth+Behind+The+Dead+Sea+Scrolls-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23b859e99aa8155ed8025c44be3824ac704fb2cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,184,89,233,154,168,21,94,216,2,92,68,190,56,36,172,112,79,178,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
