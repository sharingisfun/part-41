Each monitor is connected to its own PC. When the user moves the mouse over to a given monitor, the user is then controlling that PC. \n\nIt's ideal for power users, engineers, graphics designers, gamers, or anyone else who has ever seen the benefit of multiple monitors but wants the full power of multiple computers working seamlessly together. Multiplicity Pro even lets you copy and paste folders/files between machines. \n\nPlease note: Multiplicity is not a &quot;remote desktop&quot; application. Each system continues to need its own monitor to display that PC. Multiplicity is used to seamlessly move between multiple machines and control them from one primary PC. \n\n\nFor More Info Go Here\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.stardock.com/products/multiplicity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.stardock.com/products/multiplicity/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE NOTE\nBefore you apply serial copy crack into installation directory!!!\nDONT FORGET OR THE SERIAL WILL NOT WORK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d5c3481f180582150f58666e5d4fd2e639a029b","amp;dn":"Stardock.Multiplicity.1.02.Professional.Plus.Crack%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d5c3481f180582150f58666e5d4fd2e639a029b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,92,52,129,241,128,88,33,80,245,134,102,229,212,253,46,99,154,2,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
