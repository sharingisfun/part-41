The dark and spooky ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Body Of MineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, contemplates death, and again is brilliantly original . .  a brooding bass line from Fergie Fulton, some tough amplifed harmonica from Giles King, and resonator guitar from Fisk, with JoJo BurgessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals building to a crescendo.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“AeroplaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another rocker which rides on a great harmonica and guitar hook, and the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtight as they comeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ partnership of Fergie Fulton and Stephen Cutmore very impressive. The almost show-like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Birds In The RaftersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ changes tempo again . . . the wry tale of a 20-hour stay in an Indian railway station, and its nightmarish implications . .  . Giles KingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ amplified harmonica playing showing great tone and technique, with a great guitar solo from Fisk that never overstays its welcome.\n\nCutmoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drums pound out a jungle rhythm on the intro to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ApologiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ before the band join in, the song having a rolling, jangly feel to it; they return to Eastern Europe for the sparse starting Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jackie BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a tale of an old dog, whose bone is not for sharing, before the tempo increases on this jaunty, folky song; the dietary lesson that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Watch What We EatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has another wry lyric, and features more splendid, yet simple guitar and harmonica from Messrs. Fisk and King, and great harmony vocals.\n\nThe closing two songs are the jangly, swinging and dreamlike Ã¢â‚¬Å“RemingtonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the epic here, the lengthy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bang Bang, the seven minute plus outlaw tale, that once again sees the guitar and harmonica pairing on top form, embellishing JoJo BurgessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rasping vocal . . . a suitably spectacular ending to one of the finest British releases this year, from a great and truly different band who are not afraid to take chances . . . hats off to them for that!\n\nGRAHAME RHODES\n\n\n320kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aca851d19615ea0af308b48379a803066c4bcfe","amp;dn":"Hokie+Joint+-+The+Music+Starts+to+Play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aca851d19615ea0af308b48379a803066c4bcfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,202,133,29,25,97,94,160,175,48,139,72,55,154,128,48,102,196,188,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
