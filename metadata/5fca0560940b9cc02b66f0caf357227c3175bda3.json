Their rights  are disappearing into nothingness; their privacy is a thing of the past; their every move is observed and recorded; and hundreds of thousands of human lives  are callously extinguished and millions more destroyed, in their name. Their own money is being used against them. They are even forced to pay for their own oppression. The deteriorating situation in America hasn't a prayer of improving, because the majority of the people are unaware, don't care, or are too lethargic to act.  Unwilling to have their lives at the mercy of such people, they seek a viable solution. Realizing that working within the system is futile, they are set out to rally as many like-minded people as they can and leave the system. Naturally, the establishment has other ideas.  The War Between the States ended the last attempt to leave the Union. If they are to succeed, the price of stopping them must be so high the federal government is unwilling or unable to pay it.  An idea whose time has come.\n\n356 pages. 193,000 words.\n.lit format for Microsoft Reader\nlanguage - english","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fca0560940b9cc02b66f0caf357227c3175bda3","amp;dn":"A+Most+Sacred+Right+ebook+re+freedom+and+secession.lit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fca0560940b9cc02b66f0caf357227c3175bda3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,202,5,96,148,11,156,192,43,102,240,202,243,87,34,124,49,117,189,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
