This means: no computers, no artificial beats... what you see on stage is what you hear. But that doesn't mean we don't like to listen and dance to electronic dance-club music! And that's the &quot;raison d'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªtre&quot; for this release; a remix CD filled to the brim with OMNIA's shamanic Pagan sound warped by all sorts of groovy computer tricks, subsonic beats, freaky sample tracks... the works!\n\nThis is Omnia's &quot;dance-remix&quot; CD - was released June 2007.\n\n1.
