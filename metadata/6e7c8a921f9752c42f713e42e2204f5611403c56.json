The docks are facing closure and time-honoured ancient fiddles like Cat in a Box and Fat Man are on the way out. But while Spud rues the doors that are closing, Danny finds himself stepping into a parallel universe where actual telly programmes can be watched again in your own front room with Churcher's incredible video recorder. Now all Danny needs to figure out is how to rustle up the 100 quid he's pledged to pay for it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e7c8a921f9752c42f713e42e2204f5611403c56","amp;dn":"Cradle.to.Grave.s01e03.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e7c8a921f9752c42f713e42e2204f5611403c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,124,138,146,31,151,82,196,47,113,62,66,226,32,79,86,17,64,60,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
