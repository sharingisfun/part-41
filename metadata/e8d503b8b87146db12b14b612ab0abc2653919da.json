She achieved great success with the vocal quartet; gaining Classical Brit Award nominations, record breaking sales, platinum status and performing in venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and the London's O2.  After three albums, Wright left the group in 2010 and has since been signed as a solo artist under Decca.  Her debut album, The Last Rose, emphasises the fusion of classical and folk music.  Vocally (and to put it simply) Wright has an incredible sound.  Trained as a choirgirl, Wright is not operatic but is not restrained by the traditional choral inflexibility; her tone is appealing and pure, her interpretation expressive and she possesses a wide range which allows for diverse material.\n\nIn 2005, at the age of 15, Laura Wright won the BBC Radio 2 Chorister of the Year award for female voice. She then soon became a member of quartet All Angels from its formation until June 2010 and thus performed on three of their albums while also still studying at school. (Her place in the quartet was then taken Ã¢â‚¬â€ in July 2010 Ã¢â‚¬â€ by Rachel Fabri.)\nLaura is best known since then for her debut solo album of folk (and folk style) songs, The Last Rose, released in 2011. It got #1 album position on the Classical Compilation Albums Chart of Official Charts. Her inspiration for the album, which was her own idea, was a Christmas gift in 2010 of a book of traditional songs of the British isles. In 2011 Laura was studying at the Royal College of Music in London and also working as a waitress.\nShe was also a guest artist on the 2011/2012 UK tour of English tenor Alfie Boe.[8]\nOutside of singing, Laura began running and cycling and took part in the 2011 London Marathon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d503b8b87146db12b14b612ab0abc2653919da","amp;dn":"Laura+Wright+-+Glorious+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d503b8b87146db12b14b612ab0abc2653919da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,213,3,184,184,113,70,219,18,177,75,97,42,176,171,194,101,57,25,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
