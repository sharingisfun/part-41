In it, we witness Eddie's progression from 'beer to wine,' or to put it more accurately, his inevitable maturation through time. Whether it's tales of his early pub-crawlin' days, or glimpses into his current private life with 'wifey' and kids, there are 'truths' here that transcend the factual and paint a picture of the way life should be. This collection, numbered at 51 in The Comics Journal's top comics of the century, has been much sought after by collectors of the serious graphic novel as well as readers new to the idea of comics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07952b9e277fec0ff0eba42db0834c94156a21f8","amp;dn":"Eddie+Campbell+-+Alec+-+The+King+Canute+Crowd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07952b9e277fec0ff0eba42db0834c94156a21f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,149,43,158,39,127,236,15,240,235,164,45,176,131,76,148,21,106,33,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
