Studios, written by Michael Alan Nelson and drawn by Declan Shalvey and Alejandro Aragon.\n\nThe series follows on from the events of 28 Days Later, initially taking place in the gap between it and the sequel, 28 Weeks Later, much like the graphic novel 28 Days Later: The Aftermath, and as such references the upcoming American NATO occupation. Issues 22, 23 and 24 directly reference events from the second movie, and takes place in the same time frame, ending with the Rage Virus spreading into mainland Europe.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later_%28comics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later_%28comics%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/28-days-later/49-27555/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/28-days-later/49-27555/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34517e46d78cf346982531675bbd256e904375e0","amp;dn":"28+Days+Later+%28Comic+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34517e46d78cf346982531675bbd256e904375e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,81,126,70,215,140,243,70,152,37,49,103,91,189,37,110,144,67,117,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
