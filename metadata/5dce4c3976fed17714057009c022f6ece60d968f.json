The character rolls with a constant speed so that the player can focus on jumping and dashing monsters with an intuitive one-touch control!\n\nBased on the good old Jump N Run Game-Mechanics, Ã¢â‚¬ËœJump N RollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is reduces to Jump only to enable intuitive OneTouch-Control.\nTo be able to do one single Mid-Air-Jump is pretty cool, but it is a lot more fun to do Mid-Air Jumps over and over again!\n\nThe character can switch to the back-layer when jumping on red mushrooms. The reward is much higher there, but it is more dangerous and only the bravest jumpers should choose this path.\n\nHighlights:\n\n* 90 challenging quests!\n* 4 unique stages!\n* Intuitive one touch control!\n* Dash to get rid of the various monsters!\n* Lots of useful upgrades!\n* Jump to the back-layer to get more points!\n* Explore bonus-areas with lots of coins and diamonds!\n* Easy to pick up, but hard to master!\n* Addictive Old School gameplay!\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.games2be.jumpnroll&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.games2be.jumpnroll&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dce4c3976fed17714057009c022f6ece60d968f","amp;dn":"Jump+N+Roll+v1.2.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dce4c3976fed17714057009c022f6ece60d968f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,206,76,57,118,254,209,119,20,5,112,9,192,34,246,236,230,13,150,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
