Impressionist Alistair McGowan, former minister Ann Widdecombe, actress Zoe Lucker, world champion hurdler Colin Jackson, actor Tyger Drew-Honey and presenter Miquita Oliver are the volunteers.\n\n\n1)  The Dustyard \nTheir first 24 hours lands them in the filth and grime of the city dump - the dustyard. Here, they must sift through mountains of dirt, rotting vegetables and old bones. With thousands of people flooding into cities to find work in the new factories, there is a whole lot of horse manure and human effluent to clean up.\n\n2)  Coaching Inn \nThis week finds them constantly against the clock as there are horses to be groomed, coaches to be cleaned, guests to be fed, sheets to be laundered and chamber pots to be emptied. Will they all have the stamina to survive the long hours and relentless grind - especially with two further days to go?\n\n3)  The Factories \nAmidst the bottle kilns of the Staffordshire potteries, it's not just the machinery that's revolutionary! With no break since leaving the 19th-century equivalent of the motorway services - the coaching inn - Alistair McGowan, Ann Widdecombe, Miquita Oliver, Zoe Lucker, Tyger Drew-Honey and Colin Jackson now have kilns to keep alight, clay to prep and pots to make. It's hard work for very little pay and dissent is in the air. Will our apprentice potters, like their forebears, take up the call to arms for better working conditions and pay?\n\n4)  The Workhouse \nRuth Goodman and Fi Glover reveal they have been saving their most gruelling challenge for last. Having spent the past 72 hours experiencing the grim reality of life in Victorian Britain, the six time-hopping celebrities must now ensure the horrors of the workhouse, where there are no rewards and only punishment. Stripped of their already meagre belongings, Ann Widdecombe, Alistair McGowan, Zoe Lucker, Colin Jackson, Tyger Drew-Honey and Miquita Oliver face relentless graft under the yoke of the workhouse master and matron, who punish anyone who dares to break the rules, and have no time for former MP Ann's acts of rebellion.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7b33121c133b374f554a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3032 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 58mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30c3e575a641bf5a17ba6a1c4850ab60b3033903","amp;dn":"BBC.24.Hours.In.The.Past.Series.1.2of4.Coaching.Inn.720p.HDTV.x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30c3e575a641bf5a17ba6a1c4850ab60b3033903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,195,229,117,166,65,191,90,23,186,106,28,72,80,171,96,179,3,57,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
