Don't like that?  Don't download it.  Don't complain.  Don't get in the way.\n\nHad this book not been written:\n\n1.  TOLSTOY:  Tolstoy would have committed suicide, rather than writing this, and a series like it, from his 50th year until is death 32 years later. \n\n2.  GANDHI:  We would not know the name Gandhi.  The young law student would have been an anonymous lawyer in India for the rest of his life.  Instead he read Tolstoy's follow-on book to this, &quot;The Kingdom of God is Within You,&quot; see this site UnviolentPeacemaker, and, well, the rest is history.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.asthabharati.org/Dia_Oct%20010/y.p..htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.asthabharati.org/Dia_Oct%20010/y.p..htm&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Correspondence_between_Tolstoy_and_Gandhi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Correspondence_between_Tolstoy_and_Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; \n\n3.  MARTIN LUTHER KING Jr: As a seminarian at Crozer Dr. King was first acquinted with nonviolence reading Tolstoy's &quot;The Law of Love and the Law of Violence&quot; (see this site UnviolentPeacemaker), also a follow-on writing to this &quot;The Gospel in Brief.&quot;  Dr. King became a passionate student of Gandhi, the man that Tolstoy created, all starting with this book.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940759,00.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940759,00.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/april-3-2009/mlk-jr-in-gandhi%E2%80%99s-footsteps/2569/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/april-3-2009/mlk-jr-in-gandhi%E2%80%99s-footsteps/2569/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe most powerful translation of Jesus' Gospel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3d8b5ff07ab0531647cc8366cfe20364dec197","amp;dn":"Gospel+in+Brief+%28GIB.+mp3%29+No+GIB%2C+no+Tolstoy%2C+Gandhi%2C+or+MLK+Jr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3d8b5ff07ab0531647cc8366cfe20364dec197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,61,139,95,240,122,176,83,22,71,204,131,102,207,226,3,100,222,193,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
