Jack Bruce, the man who singlehandedly revolutionized the electric bass as the mastermind and creative force behind one of the greatest bands ever:  Cream. Whereas Robin Trower graced the first five classic Procol Harum albums with some fiery, melodic guitar, before he had a revelation hearing Jimi Hendrix, which changed his playing style forever. So it's not surprising that this album really is 'Cream meets Hendrix' psychedelic blues at its finest.\n\nRobin shows that few others have grasped not only the sound and tone but also the spirit of Hendrix as deeply and profound as he. The drummer in this power trio is the brilliant Gary Husband, a long time Bruce-collaborator, who has also played with Allan Holdsworth and John McLaughlin, and here he shines on every track with classic triorockdrumming, rather Mitch Mitchell-like.\n\nThe album is more or less recorded live in the studio, the vibes deep and spontaneous. The songs, all written by Bruce and Trower, great! The lyrics for the most part philosophical and spiritual with lines like, &quot;Wanna stay where the light is streaming.. Find the one who's dreaming me.&quot;\n\nA must for everyone into psychedelic/blues/rock.\n\nThis torrent includes both .mp3s AND .flacs for your downloading and listening pleasures.\n\nAnd here's the DVD: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7863121/Jack_Bruce_And_Robin_Trower_-_Seven_Moons_Live&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7863121/Jack_Bruce_And_Robin_Trower_-_Seven_Moons_Live&lt;/a&gt;  \n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b18731a07bdaf82c6878536dda6748dc5fe1d47","amp;dn":"Jack+Bruce+And+Robin+Trower+-+Seven+Moons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b18731a07bdaf82c6878536dda6748dc5fe1d47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,24,115,26,7,189,175,130,198,135,133,54,221,166,116,141,197,254,29,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
