The game sees you controlling Jim Hawkins across a series of beautifully realised locations. You'll explore derelict mines and caverns on far-off planets; investigate thriving spaceports; evade and fight enemies with a precision laser pistol and put yourself to the test among the many perils of space on your rocket powered surfboard, the high-speed Solar Surfer.\n\n\nDo you missing a game? Write a comment with the game you want and I will try to upload that game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76597ec878c833482263df956098709c7ed7b87b","amp;dn":"Treasure+Planet+%5BPS2%5D+%5BPAL%5D+%5BMULTI4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76597ec878c833482263df956098709c7ed7b87b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,89,126,200,120,200,51,72,34,99,223,149,96,152,112,156,126,215,184,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
