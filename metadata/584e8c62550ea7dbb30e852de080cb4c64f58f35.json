Age of Empires III advances the series hundreds of years into the future, trading swordsmen and catapults for musketeers and cannons, while keeping the series' signature formula basically intact. What's more, the game features some gorgeous visuals and an interesting, inventive twist in its persistent &quot;home city&quot; system. So it's unfortunate that the actual meat-and-potatoes combat of Age of Empires III didn't turn out better, since what ought to be the most fun and exciting part of the game is actually the part that feels like it's seen the fewest improvements.\n\n\n\nInstallation Notes:\n-------------------\n\n  1. Install the game, when prompted for a serial enter the following:\n\n  2. Copy the cracked executable from the /crack dir on DVD to your\n     installation directory.\n\n  3.
