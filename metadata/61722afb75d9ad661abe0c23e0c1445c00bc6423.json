His method is to position Shakespeare in the close context of his world. In this way, he not only richly conjures up the texture of ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, but also imparts an amazing amount of vivid, interesting material about place, period and background.\nSome snippets: Shakespeare was secretly a Roman Catholic; the witches in Macbeth were not hags but nymphs played by boys; the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bed was for guests which was why he bequeathed his wife his Ã¢â‚¬Å“second bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bed (the matrimonial bed in which he probably died); Ã¢â‚¬Å“ham actingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ derives from the strutting walk which showed off the ham-strings; an actor called Ã¢â‚¬Å“WillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ played female parts Ã¢â‚¬â€ could it have been Shakespeare himself? And, the strongest bond in the plays is between father and daughter, perhaps reflecting ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own family life.\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nReviewed by Ron Rosenbaum. At their best, Shakespearean biographers are like great jazz musicians, able to take a few notes of an old standard and spin them into dizzying riffs of conjecture. At their worst they reshuffle old wives' tales, piling supposition upon conjecture into a rickety house of cards. Peter Ackroyd can riff with the best, and he brings to the task of making the old facts fresh some themes and variations of his own that deserve a hearing. He is particularly good, in fact, on the question of sound: the way the language Shakespeare wrote, his players spoke and his audiences heard differed from the Shakespeare we hear and read today. Demonstrating the courage of his convictions, he does something daring for a book aimed at a general reader: he renders all of his citations from Shakespeare &quot;in the original.&quot; Thus a phrase from Timon of Athens is printed: &quot;Our Poesie is as a Goume which ouses&quot; (rather than &quot;gum which oozes&quot;), an effect that can defamiliarize, often in an illuminating way.An accomplished literary biographer, Ackroyd doesn't offer a new explanation of how the glover's son of provincial Stratford became the sophisticated poetic genius of London. Instead he gives us intelligent, often elegant, variations on the old ones. Like many of his fellow biographers he warns us that a particular &quot;tradition&quot; has no corroboration and then plays it out anyway. So with such recent, hotly debated questions as whether Shakespeare spent time in his youth in the household of subversive secret Catholics, Ackroyd spins it out for all it's worth.But the great strength of Ackroyd's book is the depth of his immersion in the culture of Shakespeare's age and the sense he gives of Shakespeare as a product of that extraordinary moment in time. His feeling for the role of the theater in Elizabethan London, &quot;a city where dramatic spectacles became the primary means of understanding reality,&quot; seems to come from an impressively wide reading of Shakespeare's dramatic and poetic contemporaries. His judgments about the work itself are sometimes ingenious, occasionally eccentric, as when he tells us, &quot;All the evidence suggests, too, that the speech, 'To be or not to be' is an interpolation,&quot; an unnecessary addition to Hamlet, possibly &quot;from another play altogether.&quot; While location of &quot;To be or not to be&quot; is different in an early quarto of Hamlet, to say &quot;All the evidence suggests&quot; interpolation is an overstatement. Still, immersion in Ackroyd's biography cumulatively gives one a feeling that one has lived for a brief time in Shakespeare's world. Ackroyd constructs a an intricate mosaic of Elizabethan context, which brings us closer to the shadowy figure, whose most renowned character, Hamlet, tells us: &quot;I have that within which passes show.&quot;\nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He interweaves Shakespeare's life story with England's dramatic history and the fascinating world of the emerging Elizabethan theater. Apocryphal stories are identified and plausible explanations for what occurred during the missing years are offered. Shakespeare emerges as a thoroughly engaging, almost modern man, brimming with humor, eager for social advancement, and carefully tracking the popular trends in entertainment. Students who want to discover whether Shakespeare really was the author of the famous plays will find compelling evidence that only the man from Stratford could have hidden so many ingenious clues in his work. Sixteen pages of color illustrations include portraits of Shakespeare's famous contemporaries, photographs of the interiors of Elizabethan buildings, and illustrated title pages. Those daunted by the length of this book will find it a good reference source. Students looking for information on the building of the Globe, the meanings of the sonnets, the differences in the various editions and revisions of the plays, and other typical academic questions will find useful, well-organized information. A rich, vivid account.Ã¢â‚¬â€œKathy Tewell, Fairfax County Public Library, VA\nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When, for instance, we see a young schoolboy being badgered by a severe schoolmaster in Merry Wives of Windsor, Ackroyd lets us know why this unfortunate young scholar bears the name William: his circumstances reflect Shakespeare's own during his years in the King's New School in Stratford-upon-Avon. Others (including Stephen Goldblatt in his Will in the World, 2004) have likewise mined Shakespeare's plays and poetry for telling clues about the playwright's life. But Ackroyd brings to his biographical reading the imaginative insights of a gifted poet and novelist, along with the passions of a scholar so absorbed in the Elizabethan world that he knows which Pembroke actor curled his lip when Shakespeare gave him a line dripping with wrath and which haughty dramatist matched wits with Shakespeare when he visited the Mermaid Tavern on Bread Street. Vivid and capacious, a life study worthy of its subject. Bryce Christensen\nCopyright Ã‚Â© American Library Association.
