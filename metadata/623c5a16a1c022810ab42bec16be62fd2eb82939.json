After clawing his way to the top of the country music club scene in Los Angeles where he was described by Billboard Magazine as the king of the neo-honky-tonkers, Stinson, who wrote Dwight YoakamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stellar Ã¢â‚¬Å“Late Great Golden State,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ packed a U-Haul, chucked his place in the West Coast pecking order, and moved to Texas to start fresh.\n\nAnd Texas certainly had an effect on the cerebral Virginian who called L.A. home for 18 years. He fell in love with the space, the torrential rains, and the laid back feel of his new home, Houston. With two stellar, critically praised albums of hardcore honky-tonk and Ã¢â‚¬Å“barnyard rock and rollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in his LA past, immediately upon arrival in Texas he dropped The Jukebox In Your Heart, recorded with Jesse Dayton and his band at Willie NelsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pedernales Studios. Ã¢â‚¬Å“No One To Drink WithÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the album was voted best song of the year by the Houston Press in 2010.\n\nBut while these tunes certainly received a Texas treatment under DaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guidance, these were songs written prior to the Texas move. StinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already-completed next album, Hell and Half of Georgia, is a mixture of muscular Joe Ely-ish roadhouse bruisers and sawdust-floor tonkers mostly written since relocating. And with noted roots producer R.S. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The IonizerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Field commanding the ship, Stinson completed the best sounding, most hook-filled album of his career.\n\nA rare voice in this cluttered world of country pop and banjos-for-the-sake-of-banjos alternative country, Stinson has set the bar as high it goes with the monumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Year.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ One listen to this gripping song establishes that StinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pen is as sharp as any. Stinson is the king of broken hearts, and with Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Year,Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he captures the torment of love like few can. He also shows his cleverness by turning his problems with punctuality into a scorching Bob Dylan-ish burner called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Late For My Funeral.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnyone who knows Stinson knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a stubborn cuss, and he lets his attitude roam with loose rein on radio-friendly head-bobber Ã¢â‚¬Å“May Have To Do ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its slightly dangerous warning: Ã¢â‚¬Å“May have to do it, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to like it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Suffice to say the witty troubadour has had some day jobs in his past heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just as soon forget. He also works in the Dylan-ish verse, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Aunt Jemima said that Uncle Sam wants to send me to Afghanistan / HeÃ¢â‚¬Ëœll bring me home with a family plan and I hope you donÃ¢â‚¬Ëœt mind the sand.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFact of the matter is, Hell and Half of Georgia elevates StinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game to new heights. And with his crack road band, he remains one of the only bands on the circuit who can do a four-hour two-step honky-tonk gig one night and do an hour-and-a-half rock showcase the next without a change of expression.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder longtime Los Angeles writers like Robert Hilburn and Chris Morris flipped for StinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legitimacy, his realness, his utter sincerity, and his ruthless pursuit of his art. Texas writers like the Houston PressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music editor Chris Gray did too: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mike Stinson moved here as the pen inside Dwight YoakamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Late Great Golden StateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and soon gave Houston its best honky-tonk album of the young decade, The Jukebox In Your Heart. A wounded warrior-poet like Bruce Springsteen (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Atlantic CityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a set highlight), Stinson has recorded an as-yet-unreleased follow-up that steps on the gas and lets the heartaches fly.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe leader of one of the hardest working bands around, Stinson is winning fans one stellar song and one barn-burning show at a time..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:623c5a16a1c022810ab42bec16be62fd2eb82939","amp;dn":"Mike+Stinson+-+Hell+and+Half+of+Georgia+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"623c5a16a1c022810ab42bec16be62fd2eb82939","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,60,90,22,161,192,34,129,10,180,43,236,22,190,98,253,46,184,41,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
