She started off performing Folk music with her brothers in a 3 piece vocal group called the Springfield's, but it quickly became clear that she was strong enough to go solo, and she did producing a string of massive hits throughout the 1960's and early 70's.   \n\nIn the late 1980's her career was given a boost by the Pet Shop Boys who included Dusty on the hit single and Video 'What Have I Done To Deserve This'\n\nSadly my all time favourite Dusty Track is not available as a Video so I have included it as an Audio192bps MP3 'Going Back' is simply an under played almost unknown 'masterpiece' about looking back over life, something we will all do sooner or later.   Enjoy!
