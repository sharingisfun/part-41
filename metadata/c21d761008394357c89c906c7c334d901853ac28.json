Their first effort, &quot;Hang on Sloopy,&quot; was a monster number one smash, built around a riff and chorus that ranks with &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and &quot;La Bamba&quot; as a garage band perennial with its compelling, elemental simplicity. Featuring the lead vocals and lead guitar of a young Rick Derringer, they went on to cut a lot of similar chunky, innocuous pop/rock over the next couple years with fair success. The &quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot; sound-alike &quot;Fever&quot; was their only other Top Ten entry, and the Ritchie Valens cover &quot;C'Mon Let's Go&quot; their only other Top 40 hit.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mccoys-p19248/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mccoys-p19248/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nHang on Sloopy: The Best of the McCoys is a 22-track compilation of the group's best mid-'60s material, including all the hits and tracks from their two Bang LPs, non-album singles, and a couple of previously unissued cuts. Much of this is rather forgettable if inoffensive, other than &quot;Hang on Sloopy,&quot; &quot;Fever,&quot; &quot;Sorrow,&quot; and &quot;Don't Worry Mother.&quot;\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/hang-on-sloopy-the-best-of-the-mccoys-r216070&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/hang-on-sloopy-the-best-of-the-mccoys-r216070&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000027HH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000027HH&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
