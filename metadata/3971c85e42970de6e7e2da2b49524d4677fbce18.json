Corrections are precisely tailored to your images by taking into account the camera and lens you used. Our thorough knowledge of your equipment allows DxO Optics Pro to provide you with the best tools and the most precise settings for unparalleled sharpness and beauty in your photos. Perfect capture of real world light canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be achieved with todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commercial cameras, as the contrast between direct sunlight and shadows can reach 1/50,000 or more. Such a contrast represents close to 16 stops, definitely too much for current commercial camera sensors. DxO Optics Pro offers advanced tools to adjust contrast and tones to cope with the toughest lighting conditions, and provides you with best automatic contrast and exposure adjustment.\n\nRapid batch image processing\nAll of DxO Optics ProÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s corrections are based on what we call DxO Presets. A DxO Preset is a selection of correction parameters that is applied to all images to be processed. Thanks to DxO Presets, you can quickly and confidently process entire batches of photos according to the particular corrections or improvements you want to make (color, contrast, sharpness, denoising, optical corrections); and, too, you can apply your own personally-created presets as well.\n\nOptimized settings, thanks to our imaging expertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ know-how\nFrom the moment you start up the software, unless you indicate otherwise, the default DxO Preset is active and will be used to process all your photos. This DxO Preset has been perfectly calibrated by DxO LabsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ imaging engineers and expert photographers to ensure optimal image quality for nearly all shooting conditions, including the most difficult. This DxO Preset brings together your cameraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s default color rendering and the entire spectrum of our corrections for contrast (Ã¢â‚¬Å“LightingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), optical faults (such as distortion, vignetting, and chromatic aberrations), a moderated reinforcement of sharpness, and optimal denoising. All of these corrections are perfectly adapted to your particular camera and lens. You can use this default DxO Preset with confidence for the vast majority of your images.\n\nYou can choose to apply a preset to one, several, or an entire batch of photos at any time.\n\nDxO Presets for all tastes and all shooting conditions\nThe notion of image quality can be highly subjective. Some photographers prefer saturated colors and strong contrast, while others prefer reproducing delicate nuances of color and softened contours and edges. To respond to this important aspect of photography, DxO Optics Pro offers different tools and modes of function that permit you to process your images according to your own tastes and preferences.\n\nIn addition to its principal default DxO Preset, the software comes with with more than a dozen easy-to-use DxO Preset variants that can be applied to different kinds of images shot under all kinds of photographic conditions - high ISO, vivid color, softened contours, recovery of burnt highlights, recovery of detail in shadows, correction for anamorphosis. See the full list of DxO Presets.\n\nLast but not least, DxO Optics Pro allows you to create your own presets and save your own preferred setting parameters. Once you have experimented with settings and obtained photo results that please you, you can save the setting parameters in a personal presets file under a name of your own choosing. You can then re-apply this preset to one or more photos by selecting it from the updated list of available presets.\n\n\nPlatform : Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 8.1\nLanguage : English\n \n \n================\n[INSTALL NOTES]\n================\n\n1.
