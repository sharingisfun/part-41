Many of the songs on the album are now considered classics, and are staples of various formats of Canadian radio.\n\n&quot;38 Years Old&quot; is a fictional account of an escape from Millhaven Penitentiary in the band&amp;#039;s hometown of Kingston, Ontario, although many people still mistakenly believe it refers to events from singer Gordon Downie&amp;#039;s life.\n\n&quot;New Orleans is Sinking&quot; is perhaps the band&amp;#039;s most well-known song. When performed live, Downie often goes off on an ad-libbed tangent. In the most famous such version, a B-side from the 1994 CD single &quot;Grace, Too&quot;, he performs a monologue about swimming with orcas, one of which bites his arm off after its mate falls in love with him. This version is often known as &quot;Killerwhaletank&quot;. In other known versions, including the one that appears on the live album Live Between Us, he sings additional verses from songs by David Bowie, Joni Mitchell and The Beach Boys.\n\n&quot;Blow at High Dough&quot; later became the theme song to the CBC dramedy Made in Canada.\n\nAll songs were written and performed by The Tragically Hip.\n\n\n\nSingles\n\n&quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot; \n&quot;Blow at High Dough&quot; \n&quot;38 Years Old&quot; \n&quot;Boots or Hearts&quot; \n&quot;Trickle Down&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c33ea89d5ac3f237e46bfa20df9b5885b09cf6ec","amp;dn":"The+Tragically+Hip+-+1989+-+Up+to+Here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c33ea89d5ac3f237e46bfa20df9b5885b09cf6ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,62,168,157,90,195,242,55,228,107,250,32,223,155,88,133,176,156,246,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
