The British sextet holds its audience of a quarter-million in thrall for two hours, opening with a pummeling &quot;Wicker Man&quot; and wending its way through nearly three decades of hard-rocking tales of the mythic and supernatural: &quot;The Mercenary,&quot; &quot;The Trooper,&quot; &quot;The Evil That Men Do,&quot; &quot;The Number of the Beast,&quot; and ending with the ubiquitous &quot;Run for the Hills.&quot; Concert footage was edited by bassist Steve Harris; obviously attuned to his band's rhythms, he ensures the visuals are as in-your-face as the music. A second disc spends 50 minutes showing band members doing non-rock &amp; roll things offstage, like vocalist Bruce Dickinson's predilection for fencing and flying planes. A short &quot;Day in the Life&quot; featurette, brief group interviews, and the band's photographer Ross Halfin's photo diary round out the bonus disc.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDVD1\n01. The Wicker Man\n02.
