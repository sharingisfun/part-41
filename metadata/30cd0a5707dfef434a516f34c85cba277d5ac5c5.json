Even before cameras rolled on the recreation of the events leading up to the killing of Osama bin Laden, a government watchdog group has filed a lawsuit against the CIA and the Department of Defense since details of the reported meeting between the agencies, Bigelow, and writer Mark Boal have not been released via the Freedom of Information Act. Seems like the filmmakers have been privy to classified information. It's the sort of real-world drama the industry and those who write about it could mutually benefit from, a reminder of when American films used to resonate beyond our desire for entertainment. And how righteous the Internet can be as well.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30cd0a5707dfef434a516f34c85cba277d5ac5c5","amp;dn":"Zero+Dark+Thirty+2012+Teaser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30cd0a5707dfef434a516f34c85cba277d5ac5c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,205,10,87,7,223,239,67,74,81,111,52,200,92,186,39,125,90,197,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
