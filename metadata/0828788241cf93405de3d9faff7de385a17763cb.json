Credits for original up loaders and subbers can be found in filenames/folders.\n\nFor this torrent to survive I ask everyone to help me seed it since its a lot to take on on my own. No hit and runs please :P\n\nPart 7 Contains:\n\nShakugan no shana - Seasons 1 to 3\nDog days - Seasons 1 &amp; 2\n3x3 eyes - 7 episodes\nsaiyuki - 50 episodes\nVampire Knight - seasons 1 &amp; 2\nTrinity Blood - 24 episodes\n\nNOTE: If you don't have the hard drive space for these parts, please select what you want before you download rather than downloading the whole torrent.\n\nWorks best with VLC media player with K-lite codec pack.\n\nDate of creation - Jan 2013\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0828788241cf93405de3d9faff7de385a17763cb","amp;dn":"Anime+Collection+part+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0828788241cf93405de3d9faff7de385a17763cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,40,120,130,65,207,147,64,93,227,217,250,255,125,227,133,161,119,99,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
