When the story begins, Fujio and Mitsuo dream of training in martial arts overseas and becoming famous. When they accidentally kill their overbearing boss, they bury him at a man-made garbage mountain known as Dark Fuji, where tons of rotting garbage have been contaminated with industrial waste which, naturally, transforms the bodies of the dead into ravenous, flesh-eating zombies.\n\nFuji and Mitsuo try their best to survive in this horrific new landscape, but the hapless pair become separated after an idiotic mistake involving potato chips and a stray dog. A few years later, post-apocalyptic Tokyo has become a feudalistic society, in which the rich have enslaved the lower classes, and created gladiator death matches, pitting zombies against slaves, and Fuji and Misuo meet again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:056770eccc42b0b60a0bcf8f3a93a1088d6d6d10","amp;dn":"Yusaku+Hanakuma%3A+Tokyo+Zombie+%28Last+Gasp%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"056770eccc42b0b60a0bcf8f3a93a1088d6d6d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,103,112,236,204,66,176,182,10,11,207,143,58,147,161,8,141,109,109,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
