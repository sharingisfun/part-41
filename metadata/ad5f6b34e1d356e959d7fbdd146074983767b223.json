Mount the two ISO's to CD's, install and play! You can emulate them but you must keep the images because the game requires the CD's unless you have a no-cd crack. I haven't included one because I couldn't find one and I'm no cracker. Besides, burning 2 CD's to save 1GB of HD space isn't that bad of a trade off.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5f6b34e1d356e959d7fbdd146074983767b223","amp;dn":"Metal+Gear+Solid+PC+%282+Disc+with+VR+Missions%29+-+FLASHMONKeY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5f6b34e1d356e959d7fbdd146074983767b223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,95,107,52,225,211,86,233,89,215,251,221,20,96,116,152,55,103,178,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
