Vintage Rock chronicles all the stellar artists and music, the enduring legacy of those early pioneers - and why itâ€™s still the best way to live. Spanning the dawn of the 50s to early Beatles (pre Eastern mysticism!), Vintage Rock covers a time of Mods and Rockers, crinoline skirts and blue jeans, rock star movies and screaming-girl concerts. This special magazine rejoices in the music and verve of Elvis, The Shadows, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent and a host more, and speaks to a contemporary audience that relishes the vitality and flair of the era","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbe7fb8a3329419736a7696fa7a605e724f8477f","amp;dn":"Vintage+Rock%3A+Buddy+Collector%27s+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbe7fb8a3329419736a7696fa7a605e724f8477f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,231,251,138,51,41,65,151,54,167,105,111,167,166,5,231,36,248,71,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
