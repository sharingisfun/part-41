He appeared in 15 films, including Bernardine, April Love, and State Fair. From 1957 to 1960 he hosted his own television series The Pat Boone/Chevy Showroom. He somehow managed to finish his degree, graduating from Columbia University in New York City in 1958. And all the while, the hits kept coming: Why Baby Why, Love Letters In The Sand [which held the number one spot for seven weeks], and April Love [number one for six weeks] were huge hits in 1957. The following year he continued to put records in the top ten, including A Wonderful Time Up There and Sugar Moon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f0230d7a6d09f8e4ba46d1433c9e760db111f4","amp;dn":"Pat+Boone+-+The+Fifties+Collection+CD+3+of+6+%5B1997%2F192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f0230d7a6d09f8e4ba46d1433c9e760db111f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,240,35,13,122,109,9,248,228,186,70,209,67,60,158,118,13,177,17,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
