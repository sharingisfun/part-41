When things go horribly wrong, he can only seek help from the very criminals he used to work for. Meanwhile, across the galaxy, a man called Delta-Six wakes up in a hospital with no memory. Without knowing where to turn or who to trust, he vows to escape before he loses his identity completely. As fate brings these two closer together, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover a world where life is cheap, identities are bought and sold, and a quest for redemption can change the fate of a whole galaxy.\n\nGemini Rue will delight you with its moody background music, gritty atmosphere, and a story that will leave you thinking about the very nature of the human psyche and even free will. This is a must-have for classic pixel art, point-and-click adventure, and noir detective stories fans alike!\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGhost Master\nGemini Rue\nTo The Moon\nDarwinia\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nTwo Worlds 2\nThief Gold\nPsychonauts\nFahrenheit\nMoto Racer 1, 2\nLegends of Grimrock\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\nOmerta: City of Gangsters\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c481b60c526ad7f07a7b7adcdb4b5d1a2da2558","amp;dn":"Gemini+Rue+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c481b60c526ad7f07a7b7adcdb4b5d1a2da2558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,72,27,96,197,38,173,127,7,167,183,173,205,180,181,209,162,218,37,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
