Its concept was simple in design; deliver high-energy, danceable music, while also maintaining a level of musicality that is not commonly seen in electronic music. BIG BEATS, BIG BASS, Song structure and IMPACT are what this band does best. ill-Mannered is a trio of 2 producers and one nasty drummer that do not tread lightly in the studio or on stage. Their truly versatile sound incorporates elements of hip-hop, dub, funk and rock into a roaring electronic soundscape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d5bbc69be75ec911de1ced6b7a97a5af5ff1f6","amp;dn":"ill-Mannered+-+self-titled+debut+album+%28320%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d5bbc69be75ec911de1ced6b7a97a5af5ff1f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,213,187,198,155,231,94,201,17,222,28,237,107,122,151,165,175,95,241,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
