Fully dramatised tales introduced by Malcolm McDowell.\n\nReincarnal by Max Allan Collins\n\nUnder hypnosis at a party, hip young artist Nora Chaney becomes Heather, a high school girl attending a prom in the heavy metal eighties, where, whilst making love in the parking lot with her boy friend, she is butchered by a sexually-deranged serial killer. Is the party game just NoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid imagination running away with itself, perhaps fueled by her own hang-ups? But when Nora begins having vivid dreams that foretell current crimes by that same serial killer, still active all these years later, she joins with an investigative reporter to find and stop this madman...and avenge her death in a prior life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da7ce79f9fa0a3ddbe940e584a4c0d1c7a04b156","amp;dn":"Dreadtime+Stories%3A+Reincarnal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da7ce79f9fa0a3ddbe940e584a4c0d1c7a04b156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,124,231,159,159,160,163,221,190,148,14,88,74,76,13,28,122,4,177,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
