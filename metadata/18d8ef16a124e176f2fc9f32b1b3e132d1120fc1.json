Kristoff Bates, Kyle Severn\r\n\r\nno IMDb listing but google gives reviews and trailer\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Twisted - brutal and totally original!&quot; Horrorhound Magazine\r\n\r\n&quot;It's a balls out, foul-mouthed beast of an indie horror film.&quot; TheBloodSprayer\r\n\r\nMetal, blood and gore! How sweet is that combination. The Afterparty Massacre starts at a death metal show with the bands Incantation and Soulless playing at Peabodys in Cleveland, Ohio. During the show a female fan gets attacked and in return she lashes out. Her attacker soon finds out what happens when you push an already damaged mind too far. The killer snaps and starts killing everyone in her way until only a pile of bodies is left at the end of this bloody massacre. With the killer being as patient and calculating as she is torturous and demented, her killing spree is a precise and bloody massacre to witness.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself is a major part of this production including bands such as: 16volt, Acheron, Asphyx, Banished from Inferno, Be My Enemy, Cardiac Arrest, Crucifier, Cyanotic, Defcon, Denial Fiend, Divine Eve, Estuary, Everything Goes Cold, Fatalist, Feral, Funerus, Goreaphobia, Gravehill, Keratoma, Left Spine Down, Lifeless, Luxury Pushers, Master, Pentacle, and Ventana.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 704x480, 29.970 fps, 1680 Kbps, 01h16m13s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 448 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nRatio: 16:9\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio English with commentary track, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/p2c02fm35/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/h1o81jdtt/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/87xbkfqv5/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/o7fz3zmwx/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/m45jwbn41/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18d8ef16a124e176f2fc9f32b1b3e132d1120fc1","amp;dn":"Afterparty+Massacre+%5B2011+-+USA%5D+death+metal+gore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18d8ef16a124e176f2fc9f32b1b3e132d1120fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,216,239,22,161,36,225,118,242,252,159,50,177,179,225,50,209,18,15,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
