However, Eden Rose and Sandrose, whose eponymous album of 1972 features the same line-up plus a female vocalist Rose Podwojny, can in many ways be regarded as the same outfit. On the other hand, &quot;On the Way to Eden&quot; is the brainchild of Henri Garella, while the main mastermind of &quot;Sandrose&quot; was Jean-Pierre Alarcen. But well, my main object is to review this obscure musical object, and not to be occupied with conjectures and deductions&quot;.\n\n\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\n1.  On the Way to Eden 5:09\n2.
