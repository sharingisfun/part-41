While Lady June does take all of the lead vocals on the record, they're actually much more spoken poetry than singing, though she does occasionally hum-sing in a tentative way. \n\nHer pieces -- it's hard to call them songs, at least in the standard sense of that term in rock music -- are odd, whimsical, rather surrealistic spoken poems, delivered in a quirkily aristocratic manner.\n\nWithout demeaning her contribution to the record, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting a rarity to art-rock fans as it is without the substantial contribution of her producer and longtime friend Kevin Ayers. \n\nHe composed most of the musical settings for the poems, as well as playing numerous instruments and adding a few backup vocals. Those musical settings change the album from the rather insignificant spoken word effort it could have been to something much more interesting, as this was the era in which no one was more skilled at devising varied, whimsical art-rock as Ayers was. \n\nThere's blues, a snaky combination of harmonium guitar and bowed bass (&quot;Tourist&quot;), good-time near- reggae (&quot;Bars&quot;), minimal sustained classical-like piano, almost gospel-ish piano and chanting (&quot;To Whom It May Not Concern&quot;), and a good old-fashioned silly vaudevillian duet (between Ayers and Lady June, on &quot;Mangel/Wurzel&quot;).\n\n Most impressively, &quot;Everythingsnothing&quot; and the track it segues into, &quot;Tunion,&quot; is a largely wordless, eerily hypnotic ambient synthesizer-dominated passage that stands up to the better mid-'70s work of Brian Eno. That's not such a coincidence, since Eno helps out on &quot;Tunion&quot; and was also sole composer of the music for one of the other tracks, &quot;Optimism.&quot; \n\nAt these and other points of the record, Lady June's voice is distorted in various imaginative fashions and merged with gothic sound effects so that her poem is just one element of a sound collage, rather than a conventional poem backed by music. \n\nThe record's not for everyone, and not as accessible as even the albums of the era by Ayers and Eno.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Some Day Silly Twenty Three\n02 - Reflections\n03 - Am I\n04 - Everythingsnothing\n05 - Tunion\n06 - The Tourist\n07 - Bars\n08 - The Letter\n09 - Mangel-Wurzel\n10 - To Whom It May Not Concern\n11 - Optimism\n12 - Touch-Downer\n\n*2013 Airmail Japan / Market Square Music | DAKAIRAC-1699\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nLady June: Vocals\nKevin Ayers: Guitars, Bass, Bowed Bass Synthesizer, Vocals, Harmonium Guitar, Piano, Ukelele\nKim Solomon: Piano\nEno: Music &amp;
