ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shame. It took There Will Be Fireworks nearly four damn years to write this, and it shows. The Dark, Dark Bright is a beautiful record, and an expansive one. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a plethora of sounds attempted on this album, and almost all of them are executed perfectly.\n\nWhile 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s self-titled album was a shimmery post-rock masterpiece, the follow-up EP, 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Because, Because brought some slight folk influence into the bandsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ EITS-esque sound. The band pulled it off far better than I could begin to express in words. Clearly the band is not scared to experiment, and The Dark, Dark Bright sees TWBF delving even deeper down that path, toying with a variety of sounds. \n\nThere are, as expected, hints of folk (the opening Ã¢â‚¬Å“and our hearts did beatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and sweeping, grandiose post-rock (probable best song Ã¢â‚¬Å“RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), but then there are songs we never couldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve predicted of TWBF. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hint of ambience here (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ash WednesdayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), an almost Brand New-like track, appropriately featuring the best lyrics this band has ever written (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here is WhereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), and at times the band almost dabbles into pop, such as single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Youngblood,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the chorus of Ã¢â‚¬Å“South Street,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which finds Nick McManus declaring that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The sky can fall tonight/for all I care.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nSpeaking of, McManusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ voice is thickly accented. To some, this could be a detriment, but most should find his vocals a unique treat found in few other albums of this ilk. Regardless, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to criticize a vocalist who sings with as much conviction as he does (see: Ã¢â‚¬Å“RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). McManus isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one showing conviction here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Dark, Dark Bright is bursting with some of the most gorgeous instrumentation of 2013. The lush, swelling Ã¢â‚¬Å“River,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the dreamlike Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ash Wednesday,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Moving Mountains tribute Ã¢â‚¬Å“So Stay CloseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are all proof of that. For many people, The Dark, Dark Bright will be nothing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not even be aware of its release. But for those who do hear it, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll mean everything. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the kind of album you get lost in, and never want to find your way out of.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b83e4404ce33b50c85834430c009ebaa12a1d9","amp;dn":"There+Will+Be+Fireworks+-+The+Dark%2C+Dark+Bright+%5B2013%5D%5BLog.Cue%2CF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b83e4404ce33b50c85834430c009ebaa12a1d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,184,62,68,4,206,51,181,12,133,131,68,48,192,9,235,170,18,161,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
