Take Mel Fisher, for example. Whether it's chopping down trees, showing his daughter how to drive or playing football with his son, he's never let the fact that he's blind slow him down.\n\nThen there's Joyce Fisher, possibly the only mom in Pasadena to smoke a pipe. For her, divorce is like a second coming of age, a chance to be the teen she never was. Just ask her '80s-obsessed teenage daughter Katie, whose clothes she's always borrowing (that is, when Mom's not tagging along with Katie to the mall). \n\nAt the center of all this is Henry, the Fishers' 11-year-old son.

While reluctant to the changes this &quot;big ball of fur&quot; would bring, it's through an Adult Henry's voice-over (Jason Bateman) that we Ã¯Â¬ï¿½nd out his parents' split would &quot;allow all of us to Ã¯Â¬ï¿½nally discover... who we needed to be.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91eca11f6ff4c3557497a5310fbbd4b7588c1552","amp;dn":"Growing+Up+Fisher+Pilot+x264-NBCTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91eca11f6ff4c3557497a5310fbbd4b7588c1552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,236,161,31,111,244,195,85,116,151,165,49,15,187,212,183,88,140,21,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
