Thanks to the original uploaders!! Especially the one who uploaded the Barker, Scott, Mahoney and Henry Collections! Since I haven't saved the files to an external disc I will be sharing this collection for quite a while, at least 3-6 months. Generally upload at 300-400kbps, with max. of 500kbps.\n\nThis collection includes avi formats of the Weissmuller films, not the iso ones with multiple subtitles, which are available here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4479078/12_x_TARZAN__%28Johnny_Weissmuller%29_1932-1948&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4479078/12_x_TARZAN__%28Johnny_Weissmuller%29_1932-1948&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nContents:\n\nTarzan - 1932-1948 Johnny Weissmuller Collection (12 Films) + Eng Subtitles (.srt)\nTarzan - 1949-1953 Lex Barker Collection (5 Films)\nTarzan - 1955-1960 Gordon Scott Collection (6 Films)\nTarzan - 1962-1963 Jock Mahoney Collection (2 Films)\nTarzan - 1965-1968 Mike Henry Collection (3 Films)\n\nTarzan, The Ape Man (1981) - Miles O'Keefe\n\nGreystoke: The Legend Of Tarzan, Lord Of The Apes (1984) - Christopher Lambert\n\nTarzan And The Lost City (1998) [Dual Audio: Eng + Tamil] - Casper Van Dien\n\nThe New Adventures Of Tarzan (1935) - Bruce Bennett aka Herman Brix\nNote: Bad copy due to the original print being bad, which will primarily be of interest to Tarzan/film fanatics. Worth maybe a single viewing. Note worthy for being the only film made with participation of the Tarzan author Edgar Rice Burroughs.\t\t\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\nI would like to apologies to all the previous downloaders for all the issues with the past torrents. As far as I could figure out it was the &quot;create encrypted&quot; option which was causing the problems. Anyways, this torrent is identical to the first one with the exception of the text file &quot;Missing From The Collection&quot;, which was simply a list of movies missing from the collection. I decided to remove it as most people wont be downloading it or will delete it afterwards. Simply save to the same location and what you have already downloaded will be recognised. Once again sorry for all the confusion! I'm trying to get all the other torrents deleted by TBP.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3c0f2bbd0ab25792fc706adb7427fa77104246d","amp;dn":"Tarzan+Collection+%281932-1998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3c0f2bbd0ab25792fc706adb7427fa77104246d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,192,242,187,208,171,37,121,47,199,6,173,183,66,127,167,113,4,36,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
