About a year and a half ago, another uploader went to a considerable amount of trouble to collect many of the songs as mp3ÃƒÂ¢??s in a torrent to accompany this website. He/She subsequently created an improved version, and then apparently dropped off the scene. Much thanks to this OP.\n\nThe problem was that the files were badly labeled, and still only covered about half the songs in DunneÃƒÂ¢??s book. There was also only one cover to choose from. This is my favorite kind of music, so I reordered the torrent file to include every song in the book, and began to collect as many covers as I possibly could, as well as to correct the tags wherever possible. IÃƒÂ¢??ve used my spare time over the past month to research multiple sites and tracks, track down rare covers, convert files to mp3, and to correct tags. As of today, the only five songs of the original 88 that are still missing from the collection are:\n\nClareÃƒÂ¢??s Dragoons\nRouse, Hibernians\nJoe Brady\nRing Money\nLong March To Derry\n\nAll other songs have at least a single cover. I am asking all folks who download the torrent and bother to read this to please let me know if they have any of the missing songs, or covers that are not here, or better quality mp3ÃƒÂ¢??s (NO FLAC!!!!) of some of the scratchy LP recordings. My email address is included in the read me file of the torrent. A WORD doc of the entire book is included as well, although you will need to click on the links to bring up the lyrics. I am also doing research on each song and era to add photos and background, but I will include that along with version 4 at some later point depending on what luck I have finding more covers and the missing five songs.\n\nLastly, there is far more Irish history (and DRINKING SONGS!) than Mr. Dunne chose to include in the book, so you may want to check out the torrent IRISH CELTIC MUSIC COLLECTION, which includes more than a thousand songs.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e45fa8f3f0846f5d8e5fe13c60f69cf1d1b13dcc","amp;dn":"Irish+History+In+Song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e45fa8f3f0846f5d8e5fe13c60f69cf1d1b13dcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,95,168,243,240,132,111,93,142,95,225,60,96,246,156,241,209,177,61,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
