Be mindful of your decisions as they can bear consequences with a further reach than you may realize.\nOverview:\nAziraal, the god of fire, has fallen and the Dark Lord Gandohar is scheming as to how to disrupt the balance between the elements. Five long years have passed since the events of the first game and you, the hero, begin your adventure trapped in GandoharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prison. Now you must forge an alliance with your most hated enemy: the Orcs. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to put old enmities aside, reclaim your freedom. and save your sister in Two Worlds II. \n\nIn Two Worlds II: Pirates of the Flying Fortress, a band of fame-hungry pirates led by the legendary Captain Ed Teal, have become trapped in a cursed archipelago when their ship ran aground, where they will be damned to remain forever until aided by a hero with a strong back(thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s you) and a (somewhat) loyal disposition. Trust, after all, is no short sale in these cursed islands, especially not for a man tasked with finding the Treasure - an immaterial wealth said to manifest the beholder's wildest dreams. \n\nThe war has come home! While the bloody battle between GandoharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troops and the armies of the Orcs is raging in front of the gates of Oswaroth, the emperor waits in the depths of his palace on the outcome of the struggle for power. However, he does not know that an elite troop of Orcs, led by Rogdor, is making its way through secret paths into the fortress and is now close to the portals of the throne room.Two Worlds II: Castle Defense gives you the opportunity to slip into the role of the Emperor Gandohar and his henchman Sordahon! These villains from the &quot;Two Worlds&quot; universe are now playable for the first time ever in this strategy game, thus opening an entirely new perspective into the vast world of Antaloor. Using foresight and skill, you must defend abandoned ruins, dark forests, and winding catacombs against the onrushing Orcs. Ward off each attack with clever tactics and weaponry, defending Gandohar's throne in the Oswaroth fortress!\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nTwo Worlds 2\nThief Gold\nPsychonauts\nFahrenheit\nMoto Racer 1, 2\nLegends of Grimrock\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\nOmerta: City of Gangsters\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e42270d8bf11dbc8b51cf990a96c5b28bd94938","amp;dn":"Two+Worlds+II+Epic+Edition+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e42270d8bf11dbc8b51cf990a96c5b28bd94938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,66,39,13,139,241,29,188,139,81,207,153,10,150,197,178,139,217,73,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
