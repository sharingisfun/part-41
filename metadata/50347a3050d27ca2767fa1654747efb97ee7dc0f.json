Exuberant projects such as theBurj Arab, the Burj Khalifa and the Palm Islands attractedinvestment in dreams to transform the region. While the globalfinancial crisis kept dreams from becoming reality, this issue ofAD seeks to present a view of architecture and urbanism inthe United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other states in the wider GulfCooperation Council (GCC) at a time when greater economic stabilitypromises new beginnings. The issue presents examples ofarchitecture that transcends preoccupation with fabricating images,and traces the process of making contemporary Gulf cities, frommaterial tectonics to largeÃ¢â‚¬â€œscale masterplans. By presenting thearchitecture of UAE and the Gulf within the context of broaderregional developments and global trends, it highlights how projectsin the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have contributed tounprecedented urban growth, while emphasising the continuingenvironmental challenges of building in the region. In addition tohighlighting various sustainable initiatives intended to counteractthese challenges, the issue also explores how computational designand new technologies are being innovatively employed to mitigatethe impact of arid climates. \n\nContributors include: Ameena Ahmadi, Kelly Hutzell, VarkkiPallathucheril, Todd Reisz, Rami el Samahy, Terri Meyer Boake,Jeffrey Willis.\n\nInternational architects: Foster + Partners, Frank Gehry, HOK,IM Pei, Legoretta + Legoretta, Jean Nouvelle, Reiser + Umemoto,Allies and Morrison.\n\nRegional architects: AGi (Kuwait), DXB.lab (UAE), X Architects(UAE)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50347a3050d27ca2767fa1654747efb97ee7dc0f","amp;dn":"UAE+and+the+Gulf+-+Architecture+and+Urbanism+Now.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50347a3050d27ca2767fa1654747efb97ee7dc0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,52,122,48,80,210,124,162,118,127,161,101,71,71,239,185,126,231,220,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
