Although spring usually connotes the blossoming of new life and a time of nurturing and anticipation, the spring for these characters is &quot;blue.&quot; They can't wait for school to end and the summer to come. Their lives are balanced on the edge of a knife as they flirt with crime and their own deaths in the form of a deadly rooftop game. Each character has a different story to tell and the rebellion, questioning and frustration of these youths are palpable.
