Every single one of them, it seems. Right in there behind sardonic folkie/big brother Loudon Wainwright III and pop cabaret crooner/nephew Rufus Wainwright was one Sloan Wainwright, singer/songwriter/sister/aunt. With an expansive vocal range and rich melodic vision, she recalls ladies like Joan Baez, Joan Armatrading, and Eliza Gilkyson in no small quantities. Biting, sassy, and insightful lyrics set her apart from the gaggle of folksingers with a lighter touch. Face it, the first track on The Song Inside is &quot;Too Nice for Too Long.&quot; That should give you no small clue to her perspective. Still want to play nice? Try &quot;You Are the Feast&quot; or &quot;Bridgeburner.&quot; Both leave no question as to which hand this gal is playing -- the upper one. The Song Inside was released independently on her own Farkie Music. It's hard to understand why some artists can't seem to get the support they need to reach a broader audience. For as she sings in &quot;Bridgeburner,&quot; &quot;If I open my mouth to speak, I'm worth listening to.&quot; Here here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2001eaa7072eefa72fa1724e945c26c81498eb30","amp;dn":"Sloan+Wainwright+-+The+Song+Inside+%5B2002%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2001eaa7072eefa72fa1724e945c26c81498eb30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,1,234,167,7,46,239,167,47,161,114,78,148,92,38,200,20,152,235,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
