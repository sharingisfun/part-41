She has to escape her outcast status and her pathetic dad, who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gotten past her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. The one bright light is drama, her way out, if only she can get into the Lab, a prestigious program in London. Then Stella, JudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood best friend, swaggers in after years away. \n\nWith bold and magnetic Stella by her side, Jude knows sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capable of anything. But StellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence extends well beyond the theater. Soon StellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wild and dangerous streak begins to cause trouble for Jude Ã¢â‚¬â€ yet Jude canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bring herself to abandon Stella and the attention sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always craved. And besides, now that StellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no stopping her.\n\nIn JudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark and tangled story, British author Joanna Nadin plumbs the aftermath of loss and the consequences of becoming the person you always wished you were.\n\nGenre: Young Adult / Teen | Realistic Fiction | Contemporary","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:849bd7fcadf9171fc17c94171488702aca62a560","amp;dn":"Wonderland+by+Joanna+Nadin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"849bd7fcadf9171fc17c94171488702aca62a560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,155,215,252,173,249,23,31,193,124,148,23,20,136,112,42,202,98,165,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
