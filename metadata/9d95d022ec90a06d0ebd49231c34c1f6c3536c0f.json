A look at the art of ventriloquists. The \n first half examines basic issues, such as establishing  \n two clear personalities for &quot;vent&quot; and dummy, the       \n importance of not moving lips, the range of comedy      \n that's possible, and the doors that opened when Jim     \n Johnson appeared on &quot;Soap&quot; with his dummy. Several      \n contemporary entertainers and historians comment. The   \n second half profiles the best known ventriloquists --   \n Paul Winchell, Senor We?ces, Edger Bergen, and Jimmy    \n Nelson - and assesses their strengths. The film closes  \n with an assessment of ventriloquism's future. Included  \n are many clips of performances.                         \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n              Kelly Asbury ...
