This torrent collects all of Peter David's amazing, lauded run on the Incredible Hulk, from issue #331 to #467. In addition, all subset issues from other comics are including with &quot;B&quot; lettering as appropriate. I have also added two additional classic Peter David Hulk stories, &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;Future Imperfect&quot;, both collected in trades. This is mostly taken from a larger Hulk torrent so quality may vary, but mostly with CDisplayEX and color adjusting (auto) I have not had a problem. All credit to original uploaders and seeders and as always, please seed! Enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e05942c9bad46f64f86d1082c3e4f32b0516554","amp;dn":"The+Incredible+Hulk+-+Compete+Peter+David+Run+%281987-1998+%2B+Extra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e05942c9bad46f64f86d1082c3e4f32b0516554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,5,148,44,155,173,70,246,79,134,209,8,44,62,79,50,176,81,101,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
