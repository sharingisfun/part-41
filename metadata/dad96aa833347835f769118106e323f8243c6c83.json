Triangle Pose, or utthita trikonasana, is another standing pose that frequently follows Warrior 2. It strengthens the legs, groins, hamstrings, and hips while also opening the shoulders and chest. It is sometimes used to relieve back pain.\n\nLevel: Intermediate\nStyle: Power, Vinyasa\nFocus: Cardio, Super Sweaty Flow, Core, Strength\n\nVideo; x264; 1280*720 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad96aa833347835f769118106e323f8243c6c83","amp;dn":"Travis+Eliot+Yoga+-+Twist+and+Flow+60+min+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad96aa833347835f769118106e323f8243c6c83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,217,106,168,51,52,120,53,247,105,17,129,6,227,35,248,36,60,108,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
