The Pain That's Yet To Come (3:41)\n\n\n\nThe career of Matt Elliott feels like it's been conducted in a peculiar half-light. The Bristol expat doesn't appear to care too much for exposure, quietly releasing album after album either as a progenitor of the kind of dusky soundscapes dubstep would come to inhabit under his Third Eye Foundation guise, or turning to the mopey ruin of the folk-tinged work under his own name. The Broken Man is his latest stab at the latter, a rigidly austere set of seven songs enveloped in blood, sorrow, and torment. At times it feels like Elliott made it after falling flat on the studio floor, face down, choking on dust and bitter rumination. But these aren't &quot;small&quot; songs; this is an all-encompassing misery, grandiose in its own way, with great rushes of strings and doomy multi-tracked vocal hums zooming into the frame to pull Elliott up by his bootstraps. On the lengthy &quot;Oh How We Fell&quot;, there's even the clang of an ominous church bell, acting as a wonderfully dramatic portent of changes in mood and focus.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a09231ac1d507af665bda591dc8a1891f68444e","amp;dn":"Matt+Elliott...The+Broken+Man%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a09231ac1d507af665bda591dc8a1891f68444e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,9,35,26,193,213,7,175,102,91,218,89,29,200,161,137,31,104,68,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
