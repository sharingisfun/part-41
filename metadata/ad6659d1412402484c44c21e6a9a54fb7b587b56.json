It was based on a series of radio sketches they had written called 'Dave Hollins - Space Cadet' about a man stranded on a space ship, alone except for his computer.\n\nFirst broadcast in 1988, Red Dwarf is a half-hour science-fiction sit-com. It has so far run for 8 series, totalling 52 episodes. It stars Chris Barrie (Rimmer), Craig Charles (Lister), Danny John-Jules (Cat), Robert Llewellyn (Kryten), ChloÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Annett (as Kochanski), Norman Lovett and Hattie Hayridge (both playing Holly).\n\n\nThis torrent is ripped from the &quot;Just The Shows&quot; dvd box sets, apart from &quot;Back to Earth&quot;, which are t.v rips.\n\n\nAlso, these are the ORIGINAL episodes and NOT the re-mastered versions, so you may see slightly lacking quality for that reason. PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE H.D. QUALITY OFF A 21YR OLD T.V.SHOW!!!! ;)\n\n-frame size: 576x432\n\n-25fps\n\n-166kbps\n\n-128kbps mp3 audio\n\nPlease feel free to leave feedback.\n\nPlease seed for others to enjoy.
