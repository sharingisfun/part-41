Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the eccentric billionaire, ScorseseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biopic concentrates on HughesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life between the 1920s and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“40s, when he made striking contributions to both the film and aviation industries. At only 25 years of age, Hughes directed the most expensive film ever made up to that point, HELLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S ANGELS (1930), which Scorsese gleefully recreates here in all its sprawling, audacious glory. At the same time, he became known as an unabashed playboy, bedding the likes of Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). In the mid-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢30s, he turned his attention to the aviation industry, where he quickly became world-renowned for shattering speed and distance records. He also continued to test the limits of flight technology, building bigger, faster, and stronger aircrafts. All the while, he struggled with an obsessive-compulsive disorder that sent him into a full-fledged tailspin after a near-fatal plane crash. The film concludes with Hughes being called before the Senate in 1947 to defend himself against the nefarious Senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), who accused Hughes of taking money from the United States government during wartime.\n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nSome Men Dream The Future. He Built It.  For some men, the sky was the limit. For him, it was just the beginning.\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!!\n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
