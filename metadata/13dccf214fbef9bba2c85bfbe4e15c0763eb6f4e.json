One of the most popular acolytes of Art Tatum (possibly the most incredible pianist ever) was and remains Oscar Peterson. Put them together and you have the makings of a classy, enduring, and simmering session of straight-ahead jazz. \n\nRecorded in 1957 and '59, features bass ace Ray Brown and the superb swing/bop guitarist Herb Ellis. All are modern jazz masters with a thorough grounding in the verities of swing. \n\n\nI Can't Give You Anything But Love [4:05] \n2. Au Privave [3:59] \n3. The Gypsy [3:26] \n4.
