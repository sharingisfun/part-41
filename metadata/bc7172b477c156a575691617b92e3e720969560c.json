This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nA listener asks, &quot;What number one song took the longest number of weeks to reach the top spot?&quot;\n\nThis chart sets a record by being first time all four members of a former band (the Beatles) are in the top 40 as solo acts.\n\nOne artist in the countdown begged and pleaded with the record company for months before they released his first single. He didn't want him to.\tCasey tells the story.\n\nCasey explains how Bachman-Turner Overdrive got the word &quot;Overdrive&quot; in the band's name.\n\nOne record in the countdown moves up a big 27 spots. It didn't reach number one until 1975 but it was the only Beatles cover song to do so.\n\n40: Whatever Gets You Through The Night - John Lennon\n39: The Heartbreak Kid - Bo Donaldson &amp; The Heywoods\n38: Dancin' Fool - Guess Who\n37: Fire Baby, I'm On Fire - Andy Kim\n36: Everlasting Love - Carl Carlton\n35: Dream On - Righteous Brothers\n34: Morning Side Of The Mountain - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n33: Woman To Woman - Shirley Brown\n32: Dark Horse - George Harrison\n31: Please Mr. Postman - The Carpenters\n30: Mandy - Barry Manilow\n29: I've Got The Music In Me - The Kiki Dee Band\n28: Never Can Say Goodbye - Gloria Gaynor\n27: Ride 'Em Cowboy - Paul Davis\n26: Willie And The Hand Jive - Eric Clapton\n25: Bungle In The Jungle - Jethro Tull\n24: One Man Woman/One Woman Man - Paul Anka with Odia Coates\n23: Boogie On Reggae Woman - Stevie Wonder\n22: Longfellow Serenade - Neil Diamond\n21: I Feel A Song (In My Heart) - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n20: Must Of Got Lost - J.
