I confirmed that fact. I then examined my torrent catalogue and found, to my amazement, that there were in fact three such torrents listed. I then deleted tham all and created a new one. It is now seeding. I attempted to delete my previous PirateBay upload of Love for Lydia (1977). In the past I have had difficulty doing that. So, in order to succeed, I am naming my new upload of the very same information and &quot;update&quot; in hopes of by-passing PirateBay's efforts to call this new upload an attempt to upload a torrent already uploaded.\n\nAnyway, we will see. The information is the same as the original. The name is different.\n\nI apologize for the confustion. After all, I'm an 87-year-old fighter pilot from both World War II and The Korean War. One can't expect too much from such a man!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ebcae3b1a28d7b48aefc2181820709fe39453c2","amp;dn":"Love+for+Lydia+%281977%29+with+ENG+SUBS+update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ebcae3b1a28d7b48aefc2181820709fe39453c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,188,174,59,26,40,215,180,138,239,194,24,24,32,112,159,227,148,83,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
