The brilliant young British scientist has found a revolutionary way to beat a deadly tropical disease.\nMillions of lives could be saved, a Nobel Prize beckons.\nShe is in Amsterdam. Tomorrow she presents her secret research to a scientific conference. Watching her will be sceptics and rivals, admirers and enemies. Erica's own eyes will be on sculptor Max Carver, her new American love, to whom she wants to dedicate her achievement.\nTomorrow never comes.\nErica vanishes during the night. Max, a tough former coast guard, is determined to find her. As he digs for clues he finds jealousy, malice and cunning. But even he is shocked by the dark terror he finds at the heart of the woman he loves.\nNot only a page-turner, Bite gets to the core of the debate about pharmaceutical ethics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b879daab79ed9bf75cd15a731c599a0d28436040","amp;dn":"Bite+by+Nick+Louth+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b879daab79ed9bf75cd15a731c599a0d28436040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,121,218,171,121,237,155,247,92,209,90,115,28,89,154,13,40,67,96,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
