Bonnie interprets classics like A Change Is Gonna Come and Work Song with a gritty depth that only comes from a life fully lived, scars worn as badges as of honour. But the true soul of I CAN LAUGH ABOUT IT NOW is in BonnieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original songs and selected covers, which reflect her soul-drenched heart.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Love The One You're With\n02 - I Can Laugh About It Now\n03 - A Change Is Gonna Come\n04 - The Work Song\n05 - Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\n06 - Love Hurts\n07 - Carefree\n08 - Gotcha\n09 - No Particular Place To Go\n10 - I'm Confessin'\n11 - That Lucky Old Sun\n12 - Harlem Nocturne\n\nBONNIE BRAMLETT: Lead &amp; background vocals\nROBBIE MONTGOMERY &amp; JESSIE LUCAS (Formerly with the IKETTES).
