Carey's first compilation album, it comprises her first thirteen number 1 singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and several new tracks. It was certified 5x platinum in the U.S. after debuting within the top five on the Billboard 200, and it charted strongly elsewhere. Sales of #1's were higher than expected, and its commercial success has been credited with influencing the content of later greatest hits albums by other acts.\n\nCarey has said that she does not consider #1's a greatest hits album, and has voiced her disappointment with the omission of her &quot;favorite songs.&quot; Reviews were mixed, with criticism directed towards both the new material and the decision to include only Carey's number 1 hits. The singles released from the album - &quot;Sweetheart&quot; with Jermaine Dupri, the Academy Award winning Whitney Houston duet &quot;When You Believe&quot; from the soundtrack to The Prince of Egypt, and &quot;I Still Believe&quot; - sold well across the world, but they were only moderately popular on U.S. radio. As of 2005, Number 1s had sold 17 million copies worldwide.\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n\n\n01. Sweetheart (feat. JD) (4:26)\n02. When You Believe (feat. Whitney Houston) (4:36)\n03.
