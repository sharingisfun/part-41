In this pamphlet, McCloskey reveals what she sees as the secret sins of economics that no one will discuss--two sins that &quot;cripple&quot; economics as a &quot;scientific enterprise.&quot;\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢??s sinful about economics is not what the average anthropologist or historian or journalist thinks. From the outside the dismal science seems obviously sinful, if irritatingly influential. But the obvious sins are not all that terrible; or, if terrible, they are committed anyway by everybody else. It is actually two particular, nonobvious, and unusual sins, two secret ones, that cripple the scientific enterpriseÃƒÂ¢??in economics and in a few other fields nowadays (like psychology and political science and medical science and population biology).\n\nYet a sympathetic critic who says these things and wishes that her own beloved economics would grow up and start focusing all its energies on doing proper science (the way physics or geology or anthropology or history or certain parts of literary criticism do it) finds herself sadly misunderstood. The commonplace and venial sins block scrutiny of the bizarre and mortal ones. Pity the poor sympathetic critic, construed regularly to be making this or that IdiotÃƒÂ¢??s Critique: ÃƒÂ¢??Oh, I see. YouÃƒÂ¢??re one of those airy humanists who just canÃƒÂ¢??t stand to think of numbers or mathematics.ÃƒÂ¢?? Or, ÃƒÂ¢??Oh, I see. When you say economics is ÃƒÂ¢??rhetoricalÃƒÂ¢?? you want economists to write more warmly.ÃƒÂ¢??\n\nI tell you itÃƒÂ¢??s maddening. The sympathetic critic, herself an economist, even a Chicago-School economist, slowly during twenty years of groping came to recognize the ubiquity of the Two Secret Sins of Economics (in the end they are one, deriving from pride, as all sins do). She has developed helpful suggestions for redeeming economics from sin. And yet no oneÃƒÂ¢??not the anthropologist or English professor or others from the outside certainly, but least of all the economist or medical scientistÃƒÂ¢??grasps her point, or acts on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chinese Military: An Emerging Maritime Challenge\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Official American attitudes toward China in recent years have varied from benevolent to suspicious to guardedly hopeful. Some of the variance is due to a lack of knowledge: much of ChinaÃƒÂ¢??s decisionmaking process remains hidden to the outside world. Even current statistics on such basic issues as population and health, military size and spending and economic performance are unreliable, if not misleading.\n\nBut much of the reason for the lack of a clear vision of the American relationship with China is the very recognition of the looming importance of that relationship ÃƒÂ¢?? the very positive implications of cooperation, and the potentially disastrous implications of an aggressive competition. There is a natural reluctance to focus on the negative in fear of making it come true.\n\nNevertheless, the essential elements of American and Chinese national interests in the East Asia and Pacific region, now and even more so in the future, make competition of some sort inevitable. It is a paradox that for China, with the third largest land mass among the worldÃƒÂ¢??s nations and with a military dominated by the army, the primary strategic interests are maritime. With the exception of India, confrontation with any of ChinaÃƒÂ¢??s rivals would take place in the South China Sea or Straits of Taiwan, through which flows the oil and gas it is increasingly dependent upon. Consequently, China has increasingly turned its military attention toward developing a robust coastal defense and littoral power-projection capability designed to keep others out of areas it claims as exclusive zones, including the waters around Taiwan.\n\nToday, ChinaÃƒÂ¢??s naval and air capabilities are limited by American standards. They lack integrated information and command and control networks, have limited modern electronic-warfare capabilities, and exhibit significant weaknesses in logistics and sustainment ability. However, with a determination to purchase advanced technology from Russia and an emphasis on asymmetric warfare, China is positioning itself to challenge the continuation of the American role in the East Asia and Pacific region in the future.\n\nIf Taiwan does not take action to improve its defenses against a surprise missile attack within the next few years, the threat from mainland China to annex Taiwan by force will be compelling. And while the United States has several key initiatives underway to bolster capabilities in the East Asia-Pacific ÃƒÂ¢?? such as Aegis missile defense, the Littoral Combat Ship and Virginia-class submarines ÃƒÂ¢??a long-term commitment to counter the emerging Chinese anti-access strategy is essential.\n\nThe initial draft of this report was written by Myra S. McKitrick. All members of the Naval Strike Forum had an opportunity to review and modify the final report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Cabling Magazine\n\n\n\nFrom the Editor: As CanadaÃƒÂ¢??s premier magazine for the voice and data telecom industries, Network Cabling is dedicated to ensuring our readers get the information they need, when they need it.
