Information theoretical based measures giving a quantitative understanding of statistical complexity of such systems is shaping up as a new area of research in chemical physics. This book is the first monograph of its kind covering the aspects of complexity measure in atoms and molecules.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 313 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (August 31, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 9048138892\n# ISBN-13: 978-9048138890","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8980b132f99e559a107a29bc4c3a7efae62d099","amp;dn":"Statistical+Complexity%3AApplications+in+Electronic+Structure%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8980b132f99e559a107a29bc4c3a7efae62d099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,152,11,19,47,153,229,89,161,7,162,155,196,195,167,239,174,98,208,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
