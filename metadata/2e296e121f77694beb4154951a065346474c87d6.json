The CD is packed with songs recorded at three memorable\nconcerts in three memorable locations, Culturgest, Casa da MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºsica, and the\nOrient Museum.\n\nIn this project, one of the most challenging of his career, Bica gives rein to\nhis enormous talent as an arranger and songwriter, achieving a remarkable\nbalance between folk elements and a unique vision for modern jazz. In eight\noriginal songs and two covers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one from Marc Ribot and a Ry Cooder classic,\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œParis TexasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ all conceived as launching pads for improvisation, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarlos Bica\n+ Prima MatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©riaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a kaleidoscope of strong emotions and is a brilliant\ndocument of unique events.\n\nFor these concerts Bica, who is an established jazz bassist in Portugal and\nBerlin (he splits his time between these two locations), recruited three\nversatile Portuguese musicians, pianist JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo, guitarist MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio Delgado, and\ndrummer JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Lobo. To that stew he mixed in the young trumpeter Matthias\nShriefl,a rising presence in the new German jazz. Together they expand BicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nextraordinary musical universe, a constellation that spans jazz, blues, rock,\npop and ambient music. This original sound world moves the listener through the\nlandscapes of the great spaces, evoking artists as diverse as Ry Cooder, Michael\nNyman, Radiohead, Carla Bley, Bill Frisell, and Tom Waits. With a discography\npunctuated by such standout recordings as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAzulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (considered by many to be the\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album of Portuguese jazz), ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBelieverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSingleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (exceptional solo\nbass recording), Bica continues to innovate and surprise.\n\nHere he continues a multifaceted career that has led him to collaborate with\nartists such as Maria JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o, Carlos do Carmo, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio Branco, CamanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Pedro\nCaldeira Cabral, Janita SalomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Ray Anderson, Kenny Wheeler, Aki Takase, Lee\nKonitz, Alexander von Schlippenbach, Albert Mangelsdorf, Joey Baron, Matthias\nSchubert, John Zorn, Paolo Fresu, and Markus Stockhausen, among many\nothers. What surprises him more than their individual qualities as musicians, he\nsays, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œis the emotional intelligence that distinguishes the different ways of\ntelling a story through the raw material that sound is.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPortuguÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªs: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.culturgest.pt/actual/carlosbica.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.culturgest.pt/actual/carlosbica.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e296e121f77694beb4154951a065346474c87d6","amp;dn":"Carlos+Bica+-+Materia-Prima+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e296e121f77694beb4154951a065346474c87d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,41,110,18,31,119,105,75,235,65,84,149,26,6,83,70,71,76,135,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
