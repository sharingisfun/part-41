ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a big sounding album: awesome vocals, guitar heroics, layers of harmonies. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album that blends the Blues based Rock of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢70s with the technical prowess of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢80s. It is the result of the songwriting collaboration between singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes, and it has everything one could ask of good pop music: melody, wit, energy, and immaculate production.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 99\nArtist: Whitesnake\nAlbum: 1987\nYear: 1987\nGenre: Hard rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ff7a6fdb5353b6e05c88847ebdbcacb348a3aaf","amp;dn":"Whitesnake+-+1987+%5BFLAC-1987%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ff7a6fdb5353b6e05c88847ebdbcacb348a3aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,247,166,253,181,53,59,110,5,200,136,71,235,219,202,203,52,138,58,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
