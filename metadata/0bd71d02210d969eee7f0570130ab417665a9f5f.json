Songbird populations have been drastically declining for several decades, with a number of species facing imminent extinction. This poignant documentary explores the wonder of these tiny globe-trekking marvels, millions of which are unlawfully slaughtered each year for large sums on the black market, and follows the intrepid squad of pan-European bird-lovers waging a secret war against poachers, disrupting illegal trapping to free as many as possible.   \n\nEmbedding the filmmakers with their activist subjects, this year-long undertaking transports viewers right onto the front lines as poachers are confronted at critical migration pinch-points in Cyprus, France and Italy. A moving call to arms, Emptying the Skies chronicles a devastating environmental tragedy and the valiant journey of those risking their lives to stop it.\nDirector: Douglas Kass &amp; Roger Kass\nReactions\n\nCriticsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Pick! &quot;Emptying the Skies performs a grand and aching act of love by telling its story with a power that enrages.&quot; - Amy Brady, Village Voice\n\n&quot;If you love birds-and who doesn't?-this passionate doc about the danger many of them face is as important as it is heartrending and infuriating.&quot; - David Noh, Film Journal International\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Makes a searing imprint on the psyche.&quot; - Jen Chaney, The Dissolve\n\n&quot;An urgent reminder that immediate action is long past due.
