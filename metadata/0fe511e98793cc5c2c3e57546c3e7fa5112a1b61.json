ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also an album a lot of Daft Punk fans werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hoping for. I knew this wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be like any other Daft Punk album before listening to it for the first time, so I was not disappointed by what I heard. \n\nI did find, however, that the order and construction of the songs made for an incohesive listening experience.  So I decided to try my hand at a fan edit of the album - to create a version of the album that I would want listen to again and again. Although songs are altered, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really a remix album - IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added no sounds other than what already existed on the record. \n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided to share this with the public in hopes that others will enjoy it. But donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to purchase the original album - I intend on picking up a vinyl copy as soon as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available. \n\nHere is a track-by-track breakdown of how IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve reconstructed the album:\n\n1 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Give Life Back to MusicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (feat. Nile Rodgers) - No need to change this song or its placement. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nice little stomper that introduces the album well and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have anything jarring or weird.\n\n2 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Giorgio by MoroderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feat. Giorgio Moroder - First of all, this is such a great synth riff - I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get sick of it. With all due respect to Daft Punk and Giorgio Moroder, however, I did quickly get sick of MoroderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voiceover, so I got rid of everything he says - except a hat tip at the end, where he says his name.  I moved around some of the parts and cut out some of the jazzy solos.  The result is a pretty propulsive instrumental on the second track, not unlike Ã¢â‚¬Å“AerodynamicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on DISCOVERY - putting a (great) ballad like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Way of LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in second position didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem right to me.\n\n3 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Instant CrushÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (feat. Julian Casablancas)- I firmly believe in putting your best three up-tempo songs in the first three tracks, and I think Ã¢â‚¬Å“Instant CrushÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is quite good, although itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basically a Strokes song in falsetto (I continue to like what Julian Casablancas and The Strokes have been releasing, so this is not a problem to me).  No need to edit, but it feels good placed right after this new version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½GiorgioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n4 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Game of LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Again, great ballad. Really atmospheric. Works better in fourth position than second.\n\n5 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“BeyondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - I probably would have cut out the 45-second orchestral intro, but it bleeds into the first line of the lyrics. That said, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not bad - itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a little over-the-top. I honestly didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where to put this. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hard one to place - this just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disrupt the flow of everything else I was building.\n\n6 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get LuckyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (feat. Pharrell &amp; Nile Rodgers) - Good spot for something more dancey. I seriously considered cutting this entirely, since itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little too on the nose as a disco/soul song, but since itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the lead single, I figured I had to put it in. The album edit was too long, just adding in more repetitive Pharrell vocals, and extending the intro and outro. I figured out a way to shorten it, and make it a little more Daft Punk by adding and blending the robotic vocals with PharrellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. I also dropped out a couple Ã¢â‚¬Å“ahsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“uhsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the first verse, because I though they were annoying, even though IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m quite sure they were deliberately placed. At this point, I will note that I cut Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lose Yourself to DanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, because I think one disco/soul song sung by Pharrell is enough for the album. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s call it a b-side.\n\n7 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“TouchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (feat. Paul Williams) - Well, what can I say about this song? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty weird. I must admit that I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enjoy Paul WilliamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals, so I cut them, even though they are basically the heart of the song. They just stood out too much on the album. Also, I had to cut out that ragtime part Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so weird. So basically itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an eclectic, experimental song that ends abruptly. I kind of like that it ends so abruptly and launches into the next track.\n\n8 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“DoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ It RightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (feat. Panda Bear) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nice little song with a trappy beat. No need for changes. I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s placed well now, instead of right at the end of the album.\n\n9 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“MotherboardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ What a pleasant little song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sounds like something that could have fit on AirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Talkie Walkie - I just had to cut out all those gross noises in the middle that stops the song dead. The cut isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the most elegant, but I think it makes a more coherent song. Also, I tagged a cookie to the end Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a segment from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fragments of TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. I very much dislike that song, so removed the song as a whole, but felt it deserved an acknowledgement, since there is a reference to the album title in the lyrics.\n\n10 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“WithinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feat. Chilly Gonzales  Fairly minor cut here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the piano intro wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t doing anything for me, so out it went.  I think this fits very well between Ã¢â‚¬Å“MotherboardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ContactÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n11 - Ã¢â‚¬Å“ContactÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feat. DJ Falcon - A grand finale. What an intense song once it kicks in. I considered cutting the astronaut intro, but decided against it - the song deserves the build up, and the astronaut transmissions are more re-listenable than Giorgio MorodorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monologue about his early career on Ã¢â‚¬Å“GiorgioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need the 90 seconds of noise at the end, although it is impressive, so I cut that short.\n\n-Na5555ty Man\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe511e98793cc5c2c3e57546c3e7fa5112a1b61","amp;dn":"Daft+Punk+-+2013+-+Random+Access+Memories+%28The+Na5555ty+Man+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe511e98793cc5c2c3e57546c3e7fa5112a1b61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,229,17,233,135,147,204,92,44,62,87,84,108,62,127,165,17,42,27,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
