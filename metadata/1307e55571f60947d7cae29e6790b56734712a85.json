Featuring the stories of the remote Yolngu of Northeast Arnhem Land, one of the last strongholds of traditional Aboriginal culture in Australia, as well as the voices of national indigenous leaders, historians and human rights activists, the film explores the ongoing clash of cultures that is threatening to wipe out the oldest living culture in the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1307e55571f60947d7cae29e6790b56734712a85","amp;dn":"Our+Generation+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1307e55571f60947d7cae29e6790b56734712a85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,7,229,85,113,246,9,71,215,202,226,158,103,144,181,103,52,113,42,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
