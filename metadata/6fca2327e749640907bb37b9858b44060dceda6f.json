However, beneath the surface, this book is also an outstanding work of microeconomic theory that explains the workings of economic forces in everyday events and affairs.\n\nMurray Rothbard explains why:\n\n&quot;Defending the Undefendable performs the service of highlighting, in the fullest and starkest terms, the essential nature of the productive services performed by all people in the free market. By taking the most extreme examples and showing how the Smithian principles work even in these cases, the book does far more to demonstrate the workability and morality of the free market than a dozen sober tomes on more respectable industries and activities. By testing and proving the extreme cases, he all the more illustrates and vindicates the theory.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fca2327e749640907bb37b9858b44060dceda6f","amp;dn":"Defending+the+Undefendable+Walter+Block","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fca2327e749640907bb37b9858b44060dceda6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,202,35,39,231,73,100,9,7,187,55,185,133,139,68,6,13,206,218,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
