By changing the Clann's golden boy and newly elected leader, even to save him from death, she has unleashed a fury of hatred and fear that they cannot escape. As the Clann and the vampire council go to war, a new threat stirs: an ancient being more powerful than anything the Clann or the vampires have faced in centuries. To fight for peace, Tristan and Sav must win the trust of someone who has caused them nothing but pain and heartbreak. Soon they will learn that some bonds are stronger than love-and some battles cannot be won without sacrifice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ef8b6f6e46bf4f01ea28f94eecba9b77d5611b","amp;dn":"Melissa+Darnell+-+Clann+03+-+Consume","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ef8b6f6e46bf4f01ea28f94eecba9b77d5611b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,239,139,111,110,70,191,79,1,234,40,249,78,236,186,155,119,213,97,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
