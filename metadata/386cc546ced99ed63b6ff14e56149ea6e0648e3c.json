To Mass Observation, Nella was &quot;Housewife 49&quot;.\n\nAlthough a working class wife and mother, she was unusually literate and was able to express her thoughts particularly clearly and in great detail. These extracts from her diary cover the immediate post war era. A fascinating piece of social history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:386cc546ced99ed63b6ff14e56149ea6e0648e3c","amp;dn":"Nella+Last%27s+Peace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"386cc546ced99ed63b6ff14e56149ea6e0648e3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,108,197,70,206,217,158,214,59,111,241,78,86,20,158,166,224,100,142,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
