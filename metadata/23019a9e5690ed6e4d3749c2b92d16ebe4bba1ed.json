To recapture his youth's artistic daring, Alfred decides his next film will adapt the lurid horror novel, Psycho, over everyone's misgivings. Unfortunately, as Alfred self-finances and labors on this film, Alma finally loses patience with his roving eye and controlling habits with his actresses. When an ambitious friend lures her to collaborate on a work of their own, the resulting marital tension colors Alfred's work even as the novel's inspiration haunts his dreams. \n\n\n\nRemember to seed so others can get the same enjoyment of the movie that you've got.\nKeep in mind I can not give full speed to all, so if you're one of the lucky ones, help seed.\n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23019a9e5690ed6e4d3749c2b92d16ebe4bba1ed","amp;dn":"Hitchcock+2012+%28+Hardcoded+Dk+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23019a9e5690ed6e4d3749c2b92d16ebe4bba1ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,1,154,158,86,144,237,110,77,55,73,194,185,45,22,235,228,187,161,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
