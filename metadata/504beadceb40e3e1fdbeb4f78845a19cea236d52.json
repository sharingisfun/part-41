Becker et al. (Academic Press, 1990).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0120845601\r\n\r\nhe objectives of this Second Edition of Biotechnology: A Laboratory Course remain unchanged: to create a text that consists of a series of laboratory exercises that integrate molecular biology with protein biochemistry techniques while providing a continuum of experiments. The course begins with basic techniques and culminates in the utilization of previously acquired technical experience and experimental material. Two organisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, a single plasmid, and a single enzyme are the experimental material, yet the procedures and principles demonstrated are widely applicable to other systems. This text will serve as an excellent aid in the establishment or instruction of introductory courses in the biological sciences. \r\n\r\nKey Features of this new edition:\r\n* All exercises and appendixes have been updated\r\n* Includes new exercises on\r\n* Polymerase chain reaction\r\n* Beta-Galactosidase detection in yeast colonies\r\n* Western blotting\r\n* New procedures introduced for\r\n* Large-scale plasmid isolation\r\n* Yeast transformation\r\n* DNA quantitation\r\n* New appendixes added, one of which provides details on accessing biological information sites on the Internet (World Wide Web)\r\n* Use of non-radioactive materials and easy access to microbial cultures\r\n* Laboratory exercises student tested for seven years","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:504beadceb40e3e1fdbeb4f78845a19cea236d52","amp;dn":"Biotechnology+-+A+Laboratory+Course+-+Jeffrey+M.+Becker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"504beadceb40e3e1fdbeb4f78845a19cea236d52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,75,234,220,235,64,227,225,253,190,180,247,136,69,161,156,234,35,109,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
