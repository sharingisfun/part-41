HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s done his time, made the right connections, and now he's ready to ise them. His wife Jackie dreams of having her husband home, but sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forgotten the rows, the violence and the girls Freddie canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t leave alone. \n\nBitter, resentful and increasingly unstable, Jackie sees her life crumble while her little sister MaggieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s star rises. In love with FreddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cousin Jimmy, Maggie is determined not to end up like her sister. \n\nFamilies should stick together but behind closed doors, jealousy and betrayal fester until everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life is infected. For the Jacksons, loyalty cannot win out. In their world you can trust no one. In their world everyone is on the take\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:317188698a1ed4741fbc12e11a3f5d14889ab93a","amp;dn":"martina+cole+-The+Take%2Cmobi%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"317188698a1ed4741fbc12e11a3f5d14889ab93a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,113,136,105,138,30,212,116,31,188,18,225,26,63,93,20,136,154,185,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
