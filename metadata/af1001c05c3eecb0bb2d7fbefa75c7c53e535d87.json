These skills are increasingly in demand as more people want to make use of homegrown produce, reduce the weekly food budget, or rediscover cooking from scratch. A timely book for the new kitchen revolution, this is not only a celebration of lost skills such as curing, rendering, and pickling and a collection of fantastic recipes (such as Roasted Brine-cured Pork, Green Tomato Chutney, and Salted Peanut Brittle), but also provides advice on stocking a pantry and the best way to store cheese, cooked meats, and vegetables.
