The evaluation found that while existing DL alternatives have been effective and welcome alternatives for those that have tried them, existence of those alternatives is not widely known and needs to be communicated/marketed to FH employees. The needs analysis showed that employees need a distributed learning environment that goes beyond what we can currently offer. Employees need distributed learning options that offer instructor-led learning as well as self-paced, real-time and asynchronous learning options, and areas for collaborative learning.\n\nThey need multimedia computers that would be able to handle this type of environment, and should be provided with dedicated learning stations that they can go to in order to pursue on-the-job learning (trying to learn at one's own workstation results in feelings of guilt, and interruptions make it impossible to concentrate on the subject matter). Above all, employees need an organisational culture that supports their learning efforts, with job descriptions that include learning as part of one's job requirements. The project's recommendations include a plan for implementation of a complete distributed learning environment, including change management strategies to assist employees and educators as they adjust to a technology-based learning environment. One participant sums it up very nicely, saying, &quot;We have to buy into it [learning]. It is a cultural thing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it's the last thing on our to-do list, which is silly given that if we did it, we would be more effective. And I think that whole concept has to be embraced by everyone, not just management.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:696f2c961e0e1f31e98e8729b8360f7aa3e73802","amp;dn":"DISTRIBUTED+LEARNING+FOR+COMPUTER+TRAINING+-+Wenman.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"696f2c961e0e1f31e98e8729b8360f7aa3e73802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,111,44,150,30,14,31,49,233,142,135,41,184,54,15,122,163,231,56,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
