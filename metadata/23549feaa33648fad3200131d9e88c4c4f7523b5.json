The main focus of the book is dragged toward those materials where electronic properties are manipulated for development of advanced materials. We have discussed about the extensive usage of nanotechnology and its impact on various facets of the chip-making practice from materials to devices such as basic memory, quantum dots, nanotubes, nanowires, graphene-like 2D materials, and CIGS thin-film solar cells as energy-harvesting devices. Researchers as well as students can gain valuable insights into the different processing of nanomaterials, characterization procedures of the materials in nanoscale, and their different functional properties and applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23549feaa33648fad3200131d9e88c4c4f7523b5","amp;dn":"Nanoelectronics+and+Materials+Development+-+Abhijit+Kar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23549feaa33648fad3200131d9e88c4c4f7523b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,84,159,234,163,54,72,250,211,32,1,49,217,232,140,76,79,117,35,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
