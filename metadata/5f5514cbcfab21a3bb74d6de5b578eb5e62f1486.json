The piece consists of a single six-part suite performed by an eleven-piece band. An intensely emotional work, it displays Mingus's skills as musician, composer and band leader.\n\nWritten as a ballet, the work borrows from Ellingtonian and Latin sources, but creates a unique orchestral style that Mingus called &quot;ethnic folk-dance music&quot;.\n\nThe orchestrations (described as &quot;one of the greatest achievements [...] by any composer in jazz history&quot; by Allmusic) are rich and multi-layered. Mingus's perfectionism led to extensive use of studio overdubbing techniques.\n\nTrack A features the tuba virtuoso Don Butterfield playing a contrabass trombone.\n\nThe album features liner notes written by Mingus and his psychotherapist, Dr. Edmund Pollock.\n\nSide one\n\n   1. &quot;Track A ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Solo Dancer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“6:20\n      Stop!
