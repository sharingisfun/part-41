Bob is a movie star in town to shoot a whiskey commercial, while Charlotte is a young woman tagging along with her workaholic photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi). Unable to sleep, Bob and Charlotte cross paths one night in the luxury hotel bar. This chance meeting soon becomes a surprising friendship. Charlotte and Bob venture thorugh Tokyo, having often hilarious encounters with its citizens, and ultimately discover a new belief in life's possibilities. \n\nShot entirely on location in Japan, Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is a valentine to the nature of close friendship and to the city of Tokyo. Ms. Coppola's film, from her original screenplay, contemplates the unexpected connections we make that might not last - yet stay with us forever.\n\nTITLE......| Lost in Translation \nYEAR.......| 2003 \nGENRE......| Drama | Romance \nRUNTIME....| 01:41:46 \nIMDB URL...| http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/ \nVIDEO......| 1920 x 1080 | 23.976fps | x264 \nAUDIO......| AAC 48000Hz 320 kb/s (6 chnls) \nLANGUAGE...| English | French | Spanish | Italian \nSIZE.......| 11.2 GB \nSOURCE.....| HD-DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a79776157a1ad3c6da95fe149805dace0c68f8c7","amp;dn":"Lost+In+Translation+1080p+MultiAudio+D4R10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a79776157a1ad3c6da95fe149805dace0c68f8c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,151,118,21,122,26,211,198,218,149,254,20,152,5,218,206,12,104,248,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
