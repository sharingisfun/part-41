A monstrous curse is consuming a young woman. Only the flesh of beast dwelling within the Thirteen Towers can save her...\n(From BackCover)\n\nPandora's Tower focuses on Aeron's travels into the Thirteen Tower to break the curse on Elena. Aeron does this by using Mavda's Oraclos Chain to solve puzzles and defeat monsters. A certain set of these monsters are referred to as beasts, as their flesh can be used to temporarily reverse the effects of the curse. The primary objective of the game is to acquire the &quot;Master Flesh&quot; from each tower's master beast, as this is the only way to break the curse.\n(From Wiki)\n\n\nNote: This is my second torrent im glad to be able to give back to you guys ^^ This is the second of four games I have planed to upload today.\n\nThanks and Please Seed ^^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cfafdb4804a036f5ade013a93b1e0e5342f6db9","amp;dn":"Pandora%27s+Tower+%28WBFS%29+%5BSX3P01%5D+%7BPAL%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cfafdb4804a036f5ade013a93b1e0e5342f6db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,250,253,180,128,74,3,111,90,222,1,58,147,177,224,229,52,47,109,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
