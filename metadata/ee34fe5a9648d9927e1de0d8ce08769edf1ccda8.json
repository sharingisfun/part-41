Each episode takes two of the world's greatest combatants as they face their ultimate tests against each other.\n\n\nNarrator : Harry Chase\nScript Writer &amp; Historical Advisor : Ian Passingham\nEditorial Director : Charles Messenger\nProducer / Director : Jonathan Martin\nExecutive Producer : Philip Nugus\n\nProduced by Nugus/Martin Productions Ltd for The History Channel (2000)\n\n\n\nEpisode 11 : Buckner vs Ushijima - Okinawa \nWith the war in Europe in its final throes and Japanese resistance crumbling, it was hoped that an American assault on the home island of Okinawa would be relatively straightforward. When the first waves of troops and Marines under Simon Bolivar Buckner went ashore against only token resistance, this hope seemed justified. But the Japanese commander, Mitsuru Ushijima, had other ideas, and soon the Americans were coming up against formidable defence lines manned by fanatical defenders. The battle became one of the bloodiest of the Pacific War, and before it ended, both commanders were dead.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee34fe5a9648d9927e1de0d8ce08769edf1ccda8","amp;dn":"HC.Clash.of.Warriors.11of16.Buckner.vs.Ushijima.Okinawa.XviD.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee34fe5a9648d9927e1de0d8ce08769edf1ccda8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,52,254,90,150,72,217,146,126,29,224,216,206,8,118,158,223,28,205,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
