When he is ordered to go the American Embassy in Yemen, when it&amp;#039;s learned that things there are starting to unravel. After evacuating the Ambassador and his family, Childers orders his men to fire at the crowd cause he believes that they are armed. Back in the U.S.,certain officials fear that there&amp;#039;ll be a backlash against other embassies and Americans, if Childers claim is proven to be true. So they have decided to make Childers a scapegoat. Childers asks Colonel Hayes Hodges, a man whom he knew and saved in Vietnam to defend him.
