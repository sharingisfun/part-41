Directed by Fritz Lang and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it stars Sylvia Sidney, Spencer Tracy, Walter Abel, Bruce Cabot, Edward Ellis and Walter Brennan.\n\nLoosely based on the events surrounding the Brooke Hart murder, the movie was adapted by Bartlett Cormack and Lang from the story Mob Rule by Norman Krasna.\n\nFury was Lang&amp;#039;s first American film, and is considered by critics to have been compromised by the studio, MGM, which forced Lang to make the protagonist innocent of the crime he&amp;#039;s nearly lynched for, and to tack on a reconciliation between him and his love. The film was also a major departure for MGM, which at the time was known for lavish musicals and glitzy dramas. The movie is more in keeping with the social issue films associated with Warner Brothers, like I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang.\n\nIMDB: 7.9/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0027652/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0027652/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4340ab08bed164d6442bcfadb578d2a03d3e642","amp;dn":"Fury+%281936%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4340ab08bed164d6442bcfadb578d2a03d3e642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,52,10,176,139,237,22,77,100,66,188,250,219,87,141,42,3,211,230,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
