His biggest fan, \r\nLakeridge High School student and resident metal head Eddie Weinbauer is \r\ndevastated by the news and turns to local radio DJ &quot;Nuke&quot; for emotional \r\nsupport. After a heated discussion about the deceased rock star, Nuke presents \r\nEddie with a rare demo record, the last ever recorded by Sammi and the only \r\ncopy in existence. Overwhelmed by Nuke's generosity, Eddie accepts the gift \r\nwithout hesitation, unaware of it's dark role in things to come. After constant \r\nhumiliation and a near drowning at the hands of school bully Tim Hainy and his \r\nsports jock friends, Eddie becomes enraged and vows revenge on all those who \r\nhave wronged him, much to the dismay of love interest, Leslie and best friend, \r\nRoger. Alone in his room with feelings of rage and retribution racing through \r\nhis mind, Eddie places the new record onto his stereo and is shocked to discover \r\nthat he can communicate with the deceased rock star when it is rotated backwards. \r\nPlaying upon both Eddie's loyalty and emotional vulnerability, Sammi instructs \r\nthe teenager on how to get back at those who have caused him so much pain, \r\ninstructions that the easily manipulated Eddie carries out, prompting the usual \r\n'underdog gets his own back' results. At first it's all fun and games as Hainy \r\nand his cohorts get their just desserts, but when Hainy's girlfriend is nearly \r\nkilled by supernatural forces, Eddie realizes that he is nothing more than a \r\npawn in a much more sinister plot and wants out. When Eddie tries to destroy the \r\nrecord, an evil version of Sammi is resurrected (complete with supernatural \r\npowers) and goes on a rampage at the high school Halloween dance, turning Eddie's \r\ninvolvement with the devilish rock star into a spine tingling nightmare not only \r\nfor the young headbanger, but for his school and hometown as well. Can Eddie stop \r\nthe demonic Sammi before he sends the entire town straight to hell? One thing's \r\nfor sure, the teenagers of Lakeridge High are in for a Halloween they'll never \r\nforget.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Marc Price.\r\n=&gt;-Tony Fields.\r\n=&gt;-Lisa Orgolini.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Charles Martin Smith.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Horror : Comedy.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1986.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.12 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 650 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 37mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters...................: 12.\r\n=&gt;-Trick or Treat 1986........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trick_or_treat/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 720.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 533 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 160 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06636ea1a3dd3c05d80ac92537b14b9ffb0ff09c","amp;dn":"Trick+r+Treat+and+Trick+Or+Treat+-+Horror+1987+2007+Eng+Subs+720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06636ea1a3dd3c05d80ac92537b14b9ffb0ff09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,99,110,161,163,221,60,5,216,10,201,37,55,177,75,159,251,15,240,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
