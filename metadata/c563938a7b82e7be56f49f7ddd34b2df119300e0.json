As each vanishes, her two friends share a secret. At the end they join hands &quot;in the old way,&quot; and the sudden, smooth unity between the three shadowy characters can make your neck-hairs stand straight up.\n\nThe essence of Beckettian minimalism, this extraordinarily rich &quot;dramaticule&quot; consists of about a hundred and thirty words, surrounded by long, opulent silences. It's an almost blank slate and it's magnificent. Peter Brook classified Beckett's work as &quot;Holy Theater&quot; -- that which strives to make the invisible visible -- and of all the showy adaptations in the Beckett on Film series, this simply staged eight-minute ceremony best supports Brook's notion. To be watched and rewatched.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c563938a7b82e7be56f49f7ddd34b2df119300e0","amp;dn":"Come+and+Go+2000+DVDRip+%28Short+Beckett%29+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c563938a7b82e7be56f49f7ddd34b2df119300e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,99,147,138,123,130,231,190,86,244,159,125,221,52,178,223,17,147,0,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
