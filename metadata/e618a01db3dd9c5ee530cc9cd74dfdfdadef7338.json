Having taken his revenge on the rival magician who got him sent to Hell, Stark settles in sorcery-infested Los Angeles and gets a part-time gig with the Golden Vigil, an angelic hit squad of dubious morality that's somehow allied with Homeland Security. He spends the rest of his time as a freelance slayer of monsters. When Lucifer comes to Earth, supposedly to oversee a Hollywood biopic of his life, he hires Stark to be his bodyguard, but something isn't quite right and soon the city is awash in murderous zombies. Stark has to get to the bottom of the mystery or risk being sent back to Hell, along with everyone he cares about. Profane, intensely metaphoric language somehow makes self-tortured monster Stark sympathetic and turns a simple story into a powerful noir thriller.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e618a01db3dd9c5ee530cc9cd74dfdfdadef7338","amp;dn":"Richard+Kadrey+-+Kill+the+Dead+%28Sandman+Slim+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e618a01db3dd9c5ee530cc9cd74dfdfdadef7338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,24,160,29,179,221,156,94,229,48,204,156,215,77,253,253,173,239,115,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
