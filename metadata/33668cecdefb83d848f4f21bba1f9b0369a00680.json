Coaxed into a singing career by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham in 1964, she had a big hit in both Britain and the U.S. with her debut single, the Jagger/Richards composition &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (which prefaced the Stones' own version by a full year). Considerably more successful in her native land than the States, she had a series of hits in the mid-'60s that set her high, fragile voice against delicate orchestral pop arrangements: &quot;Summer Night,&quot; &quot;This Little Bird,&quot; and Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Come and Stay with Me.&quot; Not a songwriter at the outset of her career, she owes more of her fame as a '60s icon to her extraordinary beauty and her long-running romance with Mick Jagger, although she offered a taste of things to come with her compelling 1969 single &quot;Sister Morphine,&quot; which she co-wrote (and which the Stones later released themselves on Sticky Fingers). \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.
