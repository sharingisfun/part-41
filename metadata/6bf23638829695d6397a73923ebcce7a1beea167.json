Through time and space she relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, where her teen experiences would open up a new world where she discovered her life&amp;#039;s duty was to sing. Along the trod to spread the message of truth, she became inspired by an array of artists, such as The Mighty Burning Spear, Vaughn Benjamin, Israel Vibration, Culture and an array of other foundation roots singers.  Despite the trials and tribulations of everyday survival, through the grace of Jah she managed to capture the award of Best New Female Reggae Artist 2001, in Atlanta, GA.  Dezarie  commits her work to telling the truth to ones that have ears to hear by advocating herself as an instrument of the Most High God.  Dezarie&amp;#039;s main goal is to broaden minds, in the hopes of awakening weary souls from their sleeping slumbers to accompany her on a spiritual journey to Zion on the train of Words, Prayers &amp; Power.\n\n   1.
