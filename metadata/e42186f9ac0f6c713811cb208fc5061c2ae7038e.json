That's a good thing. With Cash, you knew what you were getting. This 20-song anthology collects some of the holiday tracks he did for Columbia Records over the years, and not surprisingly, it sounds like Johnny Cash singing Christmas songs and reciting holiday-themed poems. Again, that's a good thing. Highlights include a nice version of &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; and a wonderfully balanced and soothing take on &quot;Silent Night,&quot; although everything here has that Johnny Cash essence. That's a good thing. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42186f9ac0f6c713811cb208fc5061c2ae7038e","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+The+Christmas+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42186f9ac0f6c713811cb208fc5061c2ae7038e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,33,134,249,172,15,108,113,56,17,203,32,143,197,6,28,42,231,3,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
