It was released on 2 February 2001.\n\n\nPlot:-\nThe plot is a copy of the 1985 Hollywood thriller Jagged Edge. The film starts  with the murder of Priti, wife of Shekhar (Aftab Shivdasani), a well-known journalist. Inspector Lokhande (Ashutosh Rana) investigates the case and accuses Shekhar of the murder, saying he has enough evidences to arrest him. Upon getting bail from the court, Shekhar's lawyer tells him that he will not be able to fight his case because he is a corporate lawyer. He asks him to contact Simran Bhargav(Lisa Ray), who is a criminal lawyer to fight his case.\n\nShekhar goes to Simran's house to convince her to take his case. Simran tells Shekhar that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll defend him only if she is convinced that he is innocent. Simran is battling inner demons over a case in which she got a man convicted for crime he had not committed. Her guilt increases when she learns that the innocent guy had committed suicide in custody.\n\nWhile representing Shekhar, whom she considers innocent, Simran falls in love with \nhim Ã¢â‚¬â€ a part of ShekharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan to win her trust. They end up in bed and Shekhar enjoys Simran in bed. After the court declares Shekhar innocent, Simran spends the \nnight at his house having sex with him again. The next morning, while opening his \ncloset, she finds a typewriter hidden between sheets.\n\nThe significance of this typewriter is that there have been typed 'crank' letters \nsent to her office, leaving little clues that point the finger to the swimming coach (Vishwajeet Pradhan), who had an affair with ShekharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife. The typed letters all have a flyaway 't' on them.\n\nSimran then comes to know that Shekhar is the real murderer. She leaves for the \npolice station to give the typewriter she has found. Shekhar realizes this and is on the prowl to claim his next victim. At the end, Simran kills Shekhar in self-defense.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeed it to make torrent alive\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fb7d913cab9a55333c90cdb441863d820b267ae","amp;dn":"Kasoor+%282001%29+-+Hindi+-+in+FLV+-+327Mb+-+Xclusive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fb7d913cab9a55333c90cdb441863d820b267ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,183,217,19,202,185,165,83,51,201,12,219,68,24,99,216,32,178,103,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
