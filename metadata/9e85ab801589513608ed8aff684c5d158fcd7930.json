The Kingdom of Hungary was a vast realm, at least the size of France, that endured throughout the Middle Ages whilst the Byzantine Empire was even more extensive and enduring. The Serbians won themselves a brief but extensive local empire in the 14th century; while the Bulgarians established an effective and cultured state. Other players in the confusing Balkan scene included the Albanians; Wallachians; Moldavians; Transylvanians; Croatians and many others. How did they organise their armies and fight their wars; and why did they ultimately fail? This title answers these questions ably supported by numerous illustrations and eight colour plates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e85ab801589513608ed8aff684c5d158fcd7930","amp;dn":"Hungary+and+the+Fall+of+Eastern+Europe+1000-1568","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e85ab801589513608ed8aff684c5d158fcd7930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,133,171,128,21,137,81,54,8,237,138,255,104,76,93,21,143,205,121,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
