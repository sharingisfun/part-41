Typically, content does not include anything to do with newer 3D based consoles, but may include older first generation 3D games from the late 16-bit era.\n\nIssue #4, like others, is also scheduled to be retooled. This was the first issue in which banner advertisements and small buttons were introduced to try and help generate some revenue. No one complained about instrusive placement, or distractions from content, so the plan is still going ahead, to include banners in future issues of the magazine.\n\nThere are currently 5 issues in total, 4 published and one overdue issue that is near completion.\n\n=======================================\nOld Skool Games - Issue #4 - January 2006\n=======================================\nEditor in Chief - Zachary Bartels\nStaff Writers - Eric Ladd, David K\nContributors - Tres Bradshaw\n\nGames Reviewed in This Issue:\nESWAT, Firelord, Joe Montana Football, Magical Chase, Out Run 3D, Pro Wrestling, Ranarama, Rastan Saga II\n\nArticles:\nInterview with Alistair Bowness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca0533a94aaf6490b868b9e6d6a78af905d49490","amp;dn":"Old+Skool+Games+-+Issue+%234+-+January+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca0533a94aaf6490b868b9e6d6a78af905d49490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,5,51,169,74,175,100,144,184,104,185,230,214,167,138,249,5,212,148,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
