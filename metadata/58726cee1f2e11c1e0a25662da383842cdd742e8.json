What does that mean? It means that Chainfire3D sits between your apps and the graphics drivers, and can intercept and/or change commands between the two. It has some built-in functions, and can be further extended with plugins to provide extra functionality.\n\nFeatures\n- CF3D OpenGL driver\n\n- NightMode (inspired by Jeff Sharkey, more info here)\n--- Handy shortcut to toggle on/off\n--- Supports red, green, blue, amber, salmon and custom (pro only) modes\n\n- Global OpenGL manipulation\n--- Reduce texture size\n--- Reduce texture quality\n--- Unroll textures\n--- Load plugins\n--- Replace shaders\n--- (Pro) Disable Chainfire3D detection\n--- (Pro) Dump all shaders\n--- (Pro) Force depth buffer size (EGL)\n--- (Pro) Force MSAA (MultiSample Anti-Aliasing) (EGL)\n--- (Pro) OpenGL manipulation on a per-app bases\n--- (Pro) Fix market settings\n--- (Pro) Manage installed plugins and shaders\n--- (Pro) Backup and restore settings, plugins and shaders\n\nA bit more detail about some features\n\nNightMode\nNightMode reduces the number of colors on your screen, which on OLED screens saves a lot of battery. The various modes (especially red) are also great in low-light conditions, as they have less effect on your night-vision than a full-color screen\n\nPro version\nAs outlined above, the Pro version adds a little bit of functionality. Purchasing it will support my efforts.\n\nPro version\nChainfire3D Pro is available from some warez sites, if you feel like ripping me off However I should warn you that none of those versions actually work as the real Pro version does.\n\nRequirements\n- OpenGL ES 2.0 (every 1ghz+ phone has this)\n- SuperUser / Root\n- Writable /system (it will try to remount system as read/write when needed, but the changes need to stick between reboots)\n- S-OFF ?\n- Having root access from recovery is a big plus to solve problems if you run into them (run &quot;/system/lib/cf3d_uninstall.sh&quot; as root to remove the driver and restore the old one)\n- HTC HD2\n- Samsung Galaxy S\n- Samsung Galaxy Tab 7&quot;\n- Samsung Galaxy S II\n- Samsung Epic 4G\n- Motorola Atrix 4G\n- Motorola Droid 2\n- LG Optimus 2X\n- Google Nexus S\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58726cee1f2e11c1e0a25662da383842cdd742e8","amp;dn":"Chainfire+3D+Pro+v3.3+Final+%2B+Plugins+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58726cee1f2e11c1e0a25662da383842cdd742e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,114,108,238,31,46,17,193,224,162,86,98,218,56,56,66,205,215,66,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
