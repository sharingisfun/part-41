He scrutinizes threats to humanity, such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion, and explains why we have found it virtually impossible to avoid them. Brave New World Revisited is a trenchant plea that humankind should educate itself for freedom before it is too late.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48008d798fa98c9d3f9308562febd501f9a17ab6","amp;dn":"Brave+New+World+-+Aldous+Huxley-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48008d798fa98c9d3f9308562febd501f9a17ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,0,141,121,143,169,140,157,63,147,8,86,47,235,213,1,249,161,122,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
