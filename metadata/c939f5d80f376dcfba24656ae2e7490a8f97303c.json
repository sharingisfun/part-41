Featuring integral contributions from each of the group's four members, the album was recorded in October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London and established their fusion style of both blues and rock music. It also attracted a large and devoted following to the band; Zeppelin's take on the emerging hard rock sound endeared them to parts of the counterculture on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nAlthough the album was not critically well-received when first released, it was commercially successful, and critics have since come to view it in a more favourable light. In 2003, Led Zeppelin was ranked at #29 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and keeping that position after the list was updated in 2012.[2] In 2004, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\n1.    &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot;      (Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, John Bonham, Robert Plant)    2:46\r\n2.    &quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot;      (Anne Bredon, Page, Plant)    6:42\r\n3.    &quot;You Shook Me&quot;      (Willie Dixon, J.
