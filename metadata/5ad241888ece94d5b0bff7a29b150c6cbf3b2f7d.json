Emphasizing the aims and impact of his military expeditions, the political consequences of military action, and the use of propaganda, both for motivation and justification, his underlying premise is that the basic goals of conquest and the keys to military superiority have not changed dramatically over the millennia. Indeed, as Heckel makes clear, many aristocratic and conquest societies are remarkably similar to that of Alexander in their basic aims and organization.\n\nHardcover: 240 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; illustrated edition edition (November 5, 2007)\nLanguage: English \n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ad241888ece94d5b0bff7a29b150c6cbf3b2f7d","amp;dn":"The+Conquests+of+Alexander+the+Great","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ad241888ece94d5b0bff7a29b150c6cbf3b2f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,210,65,136,142,206,148,213,176,191,247,162,155,21,12,108,191,59,47,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
