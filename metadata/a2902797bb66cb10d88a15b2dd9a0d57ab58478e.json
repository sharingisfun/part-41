The book provides guidance and case studies on the development of cloud-based services and infrastructures from an international selection of expert researchers and practitioners. A careful analysis is provided of relevant theoretical frameworks, practical approaches, and current methodologies.\n\nTopics and features:\n\n1. Presents a focus on security and access control mechanisms for cloud environments, analyses standards and brokerage services, and investigates the role of certification for cloud adoption\n\n2. Evaluates cloud ERP, suggests a framework for implementing Ã¢â‚¬Å“big dataÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ science, and proposes an approach for cloud interoperability based on compliance and conformance\n\n3. Reviews existing elasticity management solutions, discusses the relationship between cloud management and governance, and describes the development of a cloud service capability assessment model\n\n4. Examines cloud applications in higher education, including the use of knowledge-as-a-service in the provision of education, and cloud-based e-learning for students with disabilities\n\nThis authoritative text/reference is essential reading for students, lecturers and researchers seeking insight into the cutting edge of cloud computing. Software developers, enterprise architects and IT infrastructure managers will also find this work to be both useful and enlightening","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2902797bb66cb10d88a15b2dd9a0d57ab58478e","amp;dn":"Continued+Rise+of+the+Cloud+-+Zaigham+Mahmood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2902797bb66cb10d88a15b2dd9a0d57ab58478e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,144,39,151,187,102,203,16,216,138,21,178,221,154,13,87,171,88,71,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
