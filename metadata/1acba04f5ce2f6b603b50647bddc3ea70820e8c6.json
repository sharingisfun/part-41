High above, the ion storm of the century is\ngathering, bringing about a strange intermixing of reality and night\nterrors. It is up to Rune Knudsen, a Norwegian biologist, to take on a\ndesperate struggle against fear and death, and to face the primordial force\nlurking beyond the veiled sky\n\nThe heart of the game is its restrained horror setting. It allows us to\nexplore a wide range of human themes in a realistic way: paranoia\nisolation, friendship, love and so on. To us, that is the core of a good\nhorror adventure\n\nInstallation Information:\n\n* Burn or mount\n* Install &amp; play the game\n\n/TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\nQUALITY, TRADITION AND PRIDE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1acba04f5ce2f6b603b50647bddc3ea70820e8c6","amp;dn":"Alpha+Polaris-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1acba04f5ce2f6b603b50647bddc3ea70820e8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,203,160,79,92,226,246,182,3,181,6,71,189,220,62,167,8,32,232,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
