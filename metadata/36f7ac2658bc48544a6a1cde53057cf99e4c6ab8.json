Gregory Charles Royal heads up the group on trombone, and he's also working here with a young Geri Allen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who's tones on piano are brightly soaring and filled with spirit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ really igniting the album with a strong sense of energy! Royal's trombone phrasing is a bit like that of Dick Griffin at the time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a strong change from 60s use of the instrument, and a bit more compressed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ set down nicely with the rest of the group in a groove that's totally great. Other players include Warren Taylor on tenor and flute, Jeff Corbett on drums, and Clarence Lavelle Seay on bass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and titles include &quot;Dancer&quot;, &quot;Spirit Cry&quot;, &quot;Curtis&quot;, &quot;For You&quot;, and &quot;Dream Come True&quot;. Ã‚Â© 1996-2013, Dusty Groove, Inc.\n\n    Original Liner Notes :\n\n    &quot;Dream Come True&quot; marks a vision I've had for sometime. I hope that you enjoy the music as much as we enjoyed recording it. The compositions, which for the most part were written on a stay in Europe, all have their stories.\n\n    &quot;Dancer&quot; is about the gracefulness of a dancer. The melody of &quot;Trying&quot; is meant to illustrate end success in spite of temporary setbacks. &quot;Spirit Cry&quot; says just what it is, the violent yest sonorous cry of our spirits. &quot;Curtis&quot; was written for my friend, Curtis Fuller. The first half of the melody was taken from Curtis' statement on the bridge of &quot;Invitation.&quot; &quot;For You&quot; was written for a close friend and &quot;Dream Come True&quot; sums up the reality of this dream!\n\n    I would like to thank Art Blakey, Slide Hampton, and Woody Shaw for their musical support, and hope that this album marks the beginning of my dedication to the music.\n\n    Gregory Charles Royal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36f7ac2658bc48544a6a1cde53057cf99e4c6ab8","amp;dn":"Gregory+Charles+Royal+-+Dream+Come+True+%281979%29+%7B2008%2C+RM%2C+RE%2C+LX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36f7ac2658bc48544a6a1cde53057cf99e4c6ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,247,172,38,88,188,72,84,74,106,28,222,83,5,124,249,158,76,106,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
