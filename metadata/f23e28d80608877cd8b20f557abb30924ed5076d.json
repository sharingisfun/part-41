The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills.\n\n\nScreens:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/38000/photo-37950.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/38000/photo-37950.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/38000/photo-37951.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/38000/photo-37951.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/38000/photo-37952.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/38000/photo-37952.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f23e28d80608877cd8b20f557abb30924ed5076d","amp;dn":"PRIEST.2011.DVDRIP.XVID-WBZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f23e28d80608877cd8b20f557abb30924ed5076d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,62,40,216,6,8,135,124,216,178,15,85,122,187,48,146,78,213,7,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
