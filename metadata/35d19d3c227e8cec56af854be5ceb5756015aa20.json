Cannot call them Recurrents as they will likely appear back on the chart but could not leave them out. Jason Aldean and Kelsea Ballerini also chart new singles as well. As a bonus, this week I have also tossed in every song that has fallen off the chart since January (56 recurrents). So delete those Top 30 Country torrents from earlier this year as all the songs that were ever on the chart in 2015 are contained within this file. Here is the complete listing and all are 320 Kps.\n\n01 Sam Hunt - House Party (3:06)\n02 Dustin Lynch - Hell Of A Night (3:07)\n03 Thomas Rhett - Crash And Burn (3:08)\n04 Chris Janson - Buy Me A Boat (2:51)\n05 Keith Urban - John Cougar, John Deere, John 3-16 (3:33)\n06 Frankie Ballard - Young &amp; Crazy (2:56)\n07 Brett Eldredge - Lose My Mind (2:34)\n08 Kenny Chesney - Save It For A Rainy Day (2:59)\n09 Maddie &amp; Tae - Fly (3:33)\n10 Chase Rice - Gonna Wanna Tonight (3:32)\n11 Eric Chirch - Like a Wrecking Ball (3:10)\n12 Cole Swindell - Let Me See Ya Girl (3:02)\n13 Florida Georgia Line - Anything Goes (3:32)\n14 Zac Brown Band - Loving You Easy (2:30)\n15 Dan + Shay - Nothin' Like You (3:01)\n16 Old Dominion - Break Up With Him (3:21)\n17 Luke Bryan - Strip It Down (3:51)\n18 Jake Owen - Real Life (2:44)\n19 Kip Moore - I'm To Blame (2:14)\n20 Lady Antebellum - Long Strech Of Love (2:46)\n21 Blake Shelton - Gonna (3:00)\n22 Cam - Burning House (3:45)\n23 Big &amp; Rich - Run Away With You (3:40)\n24 Chris Young - I'm Comin' Over (3:13)\n25 Parmalee - Already Callin' You Mine (2:59)\n26 Carrie Underwood - Smoke Break (3:14)\n27 Brothers Osborne - Stay A Little Longer (5:32)\n28 Tim McGraw - Top Of The World (3:22)\n29 Kelsea Ballerini - Dibs (2:58)\n30 Jason Aldean - Gonna Know We Were Here (3:36)\n\n31 Hunter Hayes - 21 (3:11)\n32 Jana Kramer - I Got The Boy (3:17)\n\n--- other 2015 singles no longer on the chart ---\n\nRECURRENT Brad Paisley - Crushin' It (radio edit) (3:20)\nRECURRENT Brantley Gilbert - One Hell Of An Amen (3:34)\nRECURRENT Jason Aldean - Tonight Looks Good On You (3:45)\nRECURRENT Little Big Town - Girl Crush (3:10)\nRECURRENT A Thousand Horses - Smoke (3:35)\nRECURRENT Billy Currington - Don't It (3:04)\nRECURRENT Blake Shelton - Sangria (3:45)\nRECURRENT Blake Shelton &amp; Ashley Monroe - Lonely Tonight (3:25)\nRECURRENT Brad Paisley - Perfect Storm (3:48)\nRECURRENT Canaan Smith - Love You Like That (3:19)\nRECURRENT Carrie Underwood - Little Toy Guns (3:28)\nRECURRENT Carrie Underwood - Something In The Water (3:47)\nRECURRENT Chase Bryant - Take It On Back (4:03)\nRECURRENT Chris Young - Lonely Eyes (3:23)\nRECURRENT Cole Swindell - Ain't Worth The Whiskey (3:08)\nRECURRENT Dan + Shay - Show You Off (2:59)\nRECURRENT Darius Rucker - Homegrown Honey (3:21)\nRECURRENT David Nail - Kiss You Tonight (3:45)\nRECURRENT Dierks Bentley - Say You Do (3:30)\nRECURRENT Easton Corbin - Baby Be My Love Song (3:16)\nRECURRENT Eric Church - Talladega (4:06)\nRECURRENT Eric Paslay - She Don't Love You (3:59)\nRECURRENT Florida-Georgia Line - Sippin' On Fire (3:09)\nRECURRENT Florida-Gerogia Line - Sun Daze (3:02)\nRECURRENT Gloriana - Trouble (3:07)\nRECURRENT Jake Owen - What We Ain't Got (3:29)\nRECURRENT Jason Aldean - Just Gettin' Started (3:11)\nRECURRENT Joe Nichols - Hard To Be Cool (2:59)\nRECURRENT Josh Tuner - Lay Low (3:56)\nRECURRENT Keith Urban - Somewhere In My Car (radio edit) (3:12)\nRECURRENT Keith Urban &amp; Eric Church - Raise 'Em Up (2:56)\nRECURRENT Kelsea Ballerini - Love Me Like You Mean It (3:12)\nRECURRENT Kenny Chesney - Til It's Gone (4:04)\nRECURRENT Kenny Chesney &amp; Grace Potter - Wild Child (3:05)\nRECURRENT Kristian Bush - Trailer Hitch (2:47)\nRECURRENT Lady Antebellum - Freestyle (3:00)\nRECURRENT Lee Brice - Drinking Class (3:19)\nRECURRENT Luke Bryan - Games (2:52)\nRECURRENT Luke Bryan - I See You (3:02)\nRECURRENT Luke Bryan - Kick The Dust Up (3:08)\nRECURRENT Maddie &amp; Tae - Girl In A Country Song (3:35)\nRECURRENT Michael Ray - Kiss You In The Morning (2:58)\nRECURRENT Miranda Lambert - Little Red Wagon (edit) (3:10)\nRECURRENT Parmalee - Close Your Eyes (3:30)\nRECURRENT Raelynn - God Made Girls (3:25)\nRECURRENT Randy Houser - Like A Cowboy (4:14)\nRECURRENT Rascal Flatts - Riot (3:41)\nRECURRENT Reba - Going Out Like That (3:38)\nRECURRENT Sam Hunt - Take Your Time (3:29)\nRECURRENT Scotty McCreery - Feelin' It (3:14)\nRECURRENT Thomas Rhett - Make Me Wanna (3:39)\nRECURRENT Tim McGraw - Shotgun Rider (3:46)\nRECURRENT Tim McGraw &amp; Catherine Dunn - Diamond Rings And Old Bar Stools (3:11)\nRECURRENT Toby Keith - Drunk Americans (3:15)\nRECURRENT Tyler Farr - A Guy Walks Into A Bar (3:10)\nRECURRENT Zac Brown Band - Homegrown (3:20)\n\nEnjoy your Labour Day weekend!\nBaz-Master","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35d19d3c227e8cec56af854be5ceb5756015aa20","amp;dn":"Top+30+Country+Sept+1%2C+2015+%2B+Recurrents+YTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35d19d3c227e8cec56af854be5ceb5756015aa20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,209,157,60,34,126,140,236,86,175,133,75,229,206,181,117,96,21,170,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
