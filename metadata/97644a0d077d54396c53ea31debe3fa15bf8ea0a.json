For years, few people knew the truth about how close the president came to dying, and no one has ever written a detailed narrative of that harrowing day. Now, drawing on exclusive new interviews and never-before-seen documents, photos, and videos, Del Quentin Wilber tells the electrifying story of a moment when the nation faced a terrifying crisis that it had experienced less than twenty years before, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nWith cinematic clarity, we see Secret Service agent Jerry Parr, whose fast reflexes saved the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life; the brilliant surgeons who operated on Reagan as he was losing half his blood; and the small group of White House officials frantically trying to determine whether the country was under attack. Most especially, we encounter the man code-named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rawhide,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a leader of uncommon grace who inspired affection and awe in everyone who worked with him.\n\nRonald Reagan was the only serving U.S. president to survive being shot in an assassination attempt.* Rawhide Down is the first true record of the day and events that literally shaped ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presidency and sealed his image in the modern American political firmament.\n\n*There have been many assassination attempts on U.S. presidents, four of which were successful: Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy. President Theodore Roosevelt was injured in an assassination attempt after leaving office.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rawhidedown.com/the-book/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rawhidedown.com/the-book/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97644a0d077d54396c53ea31debe3fa15bf8ea0a","amp;dn":"Rawhide+Down+-+The+Near+Assassination+of+Ronald+Reagan+%5B128+CBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97644a0d077d54396c53ea31debe3fa15bf8ea0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,100,74,13,7,125,84,57,108,83,234,49,222,190,63,161,91,248,234,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
