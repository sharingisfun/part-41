Joseph Billo (Wiley, 2007).pdf\n\nISBN 9780471387343\n\nLearn to fully harness the power of Microsoft ExcelÃ‚Â® to perform scientific and engineering calculations\nWith this text as your guide, you can significantly enhance Microsoft Excel'sÃ‚Â® capabilities to execute the calculations needed to solve a variety of chemical, biochemical, physical, engineering, biological, and medicinal problems. The text begins with two chapters that introduce you to Excel's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language, which allows you to expand Excel'sÃ‚Â® capabilities, although you can still use the text without learning VBA. Following the author's step-by-step instructions, here are just a few of the calculations you learn to perform:\n\nUse worksheet functions to work with matrices\nFind roots of equations and solve systems of simultaneous equations\nSolve ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations\nPerform linear and non-linear regression\nUse random numbers and the Monte Carlo method","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0bf47515e12904f58d9c57b32f80c74b8a49c30","amp;dn":"Excel%26reg%3B+for+Scientists+and+Engineers+-+Numerical+Methods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0bf47515e12904f58d9c57b32f80c74b8a49c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,191,71,81,94,18,144,79,88,217,197,123,50,248,12,116,184,164,156,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
