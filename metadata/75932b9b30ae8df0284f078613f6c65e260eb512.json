This on seems to have more spirit than the sentimental Peach Blossom.\n\nThis version is totally silent (I have removed a soundtrack that was only hiss), thus you will have to select and play your own music. Part of the screen is cut off, and one reel is flipped left-right - it makes for an interesting experience.\n\nAnother youtube reseed in flv format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75932b9b30ae8df0284f078613f6c65e260eb512","amp;dn":"A+Spray+of+Plum+Blossoms+%281931%29+Ruan+Lingyu++%E4%B8%80%E5%89%AA%E6%A2%85","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75932b9b30ae8df0284f078613f6c65e260eb512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,147,43,155,48,174,141,240,40,79,7,134,19,246,198,94,38,14,181,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
