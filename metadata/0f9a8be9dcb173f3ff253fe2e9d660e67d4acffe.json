Christian. He claimed to represent &quot;a small group of loyal Americans&quot; who had been planning the installation of an unusually large and complex stone monument. Christian had come to ElbertonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the county seat and the granite capital of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½because he believed its quarries produced the finest stone on the planet.\n\nJoe Fendley, Elberton Granite's president, nodded absently, distracted by the rush to complete his weekly payroll. But when Christian began to describe the monument he had in mind, Fendley stopped what he was doing. Not only was the man asking for stones larger than any that had been quarried in the county, he also wanted them cut, finished, and assembled into some kind of enormous astronomical instrument.\n\nWhat in the world would it be for? Fendley asked. Christian explained that the structure he had in mind would serve as a compass, calendar, and clock. It would also need to be engraved with a set of guides written in eight of the world's major languages. And it had to be capable of withstanding the most catastrophic events, so that the shattered remnants of humanity would be able to use those guides to reestablish a better civilization than the one that was about to destroy itself.\n\nThis Guidebook was published by the Elberton Granite Finishing Co. in 1981.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f9a8be9dcb173f3ff253fe2e9d660e67d4acffe","amp;dn":"The+Georgia+Guidestones.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f9a8be9dcb173f3ff253fe2e9d660e67d4acffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,154,139,233,220,177,115,243,255,37,63,226,233,214,96,230,125,74,207,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
