Home In The Valley\n\n\nStranger In My Land is a collection of songs originally written by Aborigine artists who were KnoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peers and predecessors; some tunes previously recorded but difficult to find as well as several unrecorded, handed-down folk songs (which without this recording, could have been lost forever). It is powerful and moving material, heartbreaking and hilarious, downtrodden and uplifting, suffused with longing, alienation, resilience and hope; universal themes arising out of largely unexplored context. It possesses the urgency of a Alan Lomax field recording, but with a spirit that remains relevant in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40cc5bac480e36fa295f3a28385f3529cc6ed761","amp;dn":"Roger+Knox+%26amp%3B+The+Pine+Valley+Cosmonauts+-+Stranger+in+My+Lan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40cc5bac480e36fa295f3a28385f3529cc6ed761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,204,91,172,72,14,54,250,41,95,58,40,56,95,53,41,204,110,215,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
