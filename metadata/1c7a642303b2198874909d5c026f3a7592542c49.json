The setup is done before: the original album, first takes on the first disc and outtakes and undubbed masters on the second. The bootleg before mentioned shows that not all outtakes are present, a missed chance!\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“newÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ outtakes show no spectacular difference to earlier released outtakes or the masters. As known before, In the Ghetto and Power of My Love have the most difference between (some) outtakes and the masters.\nConclusion\n\nWhatever they do with this material, it stays among ElvisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ best.\nTracklist:\n\n    Wearin' that Loved-on Look\n    Only the Strong Survive\n    I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms)\n    Long Black Limousine\n    It Keeps Right on A-hurtin'\n    I'm Movin' On\n    Power of My Love\n    Gentle on My Mind\n    After Loving You\n    True Love Travels on a Gravel Road\n    Any Day Now\n    In the Ghetto\n    Wearin' that Loved-on Look (Takes 3, 10)\n    Only the Strong Survive (Take 1)\n    Long Black Limousine (Take 6)\n    It Keeps Right on A-hurtin' (Takes 1, 2)\n    I'm Movin' On (Takes 1, 2)\n    Power of My Love (Take 1)\n    After Loving You (Take 2)\n    True Love Travels on a Gravel Road (Take 2)\n    Any Day Now (Takes 1, 2)\n    In the Ghetto (Take 1)\n    In the Ghetto (Takes 2, 3)\n    In the Ghetto (Take 4)\n    Long Black Limousine (Takes 7, 8, 9/M)\n    Wearin' that Loved-on Look (Takes 12, 13, 14)\n    In the Ghetto (Take 11)\n    In the Ghetto (Take 13)\n    In the Ghetto (Take 20)\n    True Love Travels on a Gravel Road (Take 4)\n    True Love Travels on a Gravel Road (Takes 6, 7)\n    Power of My Love (Takes 2, 3)\n    Power of My Love (Take 6)\n    After Loving You (Take 3)\n    Only the Strong Survive (Takes 17, 20fs, 21, 22)\n    Any Day Now (Takes 3, 4)\n    Wearin' that Loved-on Look\n    I'm Movin' On (With steel-guitar overdub)\n    Gentle on My Mind (With track replacement overdubs)\n    In the Ghetto\n    True Love Travels on a Gravel Road\n    Power of My Love\n    After Loving You\n    Only the Strong Survive\n    It Keeps Right on A-hurtin'\n    Any Day Now\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c7a642303b2198874909d5c026f3a7592542c49","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+From+Elvis+in+Memphis+Ftd+2+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c7a642303b2198874909d5c026f3a7592542c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,122,100,35,3,178,25,136,116,144,157,92,2,111,58,117,146,84,44,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
