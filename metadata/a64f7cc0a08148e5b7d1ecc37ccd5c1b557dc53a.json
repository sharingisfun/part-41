It consists of numerous tests and assessments which examine agility of mind, powers of logical analysis, numerical, verbal and spatial aptitudes, memory and personality. The results of the tests are then collated into a final section, providing an overall rating or Brain Quotient (BQ). The brain quotient reveals one's strengths, such as connecting with people emotionally and one's weaknesses, such as a poor memory, helping readers to identify their true potential for achievement. It will help readers build and capitalize on these strengths and improve their performance in areas of weakness.
