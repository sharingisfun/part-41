She is a first-year student. Her first Ã‚Â«hand-madeÃ‚Â» acoustic solo album is called Essay. It was written in 2012 at the age of 17 and consists of nineteen songs created in 2011-2012. Each song is telling a small story, a bit exaggerated but true. Her songs are overwhelmed with emotions, still she is performing kinda cinical attitude towards life. Worth listening? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s you whom to decide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87af621cb3a132a56ce3ad3ada6bfd6f03b8306d","amp;dn":"Asay+-+2012+-+Essay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87af621cb3a132a56ce3ad3ada6bfd6f03b8306d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,175,98,28,179,161,50,165,108,227,173,58,218,107,253,111,3,184,48,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
