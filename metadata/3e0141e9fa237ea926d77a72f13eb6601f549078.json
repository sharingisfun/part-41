Following up her multiple Dove Award-winning debut, Nicole C. Mullen is back with a vengeance on Talk About It. The energetic release carries a warm and joyous feel that unites rather than divides through its incorporation of pop, R&amp;B, hip-hop, and gospel. This melting-pot strategy complements Mullen's lyrical dedication to racial reconciliation. For example, on the rocking and rollicking &quot;Black Light,&quot; Mullen sings about the need for integrity in today's leaders. She can also jam hard on such numbers as the release's title track, &quot;Witness,&quot; and &quot;Sometimes.&quot; Mullen changes speeds well on &quot;Baby Girl&quot; and &quot;Let Me Go,&quot; paying musical homage to the likes of Stevie Wonder and Sly and the Family Stone. In fact, producer (and husband) David Mullen amply uses horns throughout, giving a slight wink to '60s soul. The ultimate result is a wonderful collage of stylish influences that will please music fans on repeated listens. \n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, April 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e0141e9fa237ea926d77a72f13eb6601f549078","amp;dn":"Nicole+C+Mullen+-+2001+-+Talk+About+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e0141e9fa237ea926d77a72f13eb6601f549078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,1,65,233,250,35,126,169,38,215,122,114,241,62,182,96,31,84,144,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
