It is a metal/punk rock parody concept album written by Townsend. Cooked on Phonics tells the story of a fictitious death metal band from south-central Poland called Cryptic Coroner that sells out their metal look and sound to become a commercial punk rock band called Punky BrÃƒÂ¼ster (the band's name is a pun on the 80's U.S. television series Punky Brewster). It was released on Townsend's label, HevyDevy Records, on March 19, 1996.\n\nfrom Wikipedia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b34b347aced03d080ca3138ee00790477b7880fb","amp;dn":"Punky+Bruster+-+Cooked+On+Phonics+%28Reissue%29%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b34b347aced03d080ca3138ee00790477b7880fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,75,52,122,206,208,61,8,12,163,19,142,224,7,144,71,123,120,128,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
