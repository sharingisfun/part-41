But it wasn't always that way. The Sun used to revolve around the Earth. It was like that for hundreds of years, until it was discovered to be otherwise, and even for a few hundred years after that.

This movie's about what happened when I went looking for Jesus.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Who_Wasn't_There&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Who_Wasn't_There&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee7f68c76cdb951fd88eb4111dc6a19b62a9d0c","amp;dn":"The+God+Who+Wasn%5C%27t+There+-+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee7f68c76cdb951fd88eb4111dc6a19b62a9d0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,231,246,140,118,205,185,81,253,136,235,65,17,220,106,25,182,42,157,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
