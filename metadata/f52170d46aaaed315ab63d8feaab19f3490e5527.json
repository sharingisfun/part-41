It has been adapted for the stage, film (twice) and at least three musicals. \n\nSet in the year's between the wars, it concerns the adventures of 3 disparate individuals, the Yorkshire workman Jess Oakroyd, the middle aged spinster Elizabeth Trant and the recently sacked teacher Inigo Jollifant. They meet with a travelling concert party ('The Dinky Doos') just as the latter lose their manager. Miss Trant takes on management of the group and at first things go well, but eventually the group fall apart.\n\nAlthough written 80+ years ago, this adaptation sounds fresh and the story well constructed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f52170d46aaaed315ab63d8feaab19f3490e5527","amp;dn":"The+Good+Companions+-+Radio+Adaptation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f52170d46aaaed315ab63d8feaab19f3490e5527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,33,112,212,106,170,237,49,90,182,61,143,234,171,25,243,73,14,85,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
