The verse is remarkably fluent, gathers power as it goes, and with an almost breathless rapidity and accumulation of images, ascends with a rush that can touch the sublime.\n\nThe present selection (EMI Classics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 'Listen for Pleasure') is read, very finely, by Samuel West. The excerpts are well chosen and include extended readings of The Triumph of Life, The Sensitive Plant and Adonais.\n\nThe Triumph of Life is really a dance of death - humankind caught up in a swirling pageant of immense futility. Only the Imagination can redeem life. In a Dantesque survey of great souls Rousseau is metamorphosed into a shell of a man with burnt out eyes, and Voltaire, Kant and Napoleon ('child of a fierce hour') similarly reduced.\n\nAdonais depicts the plight of the visionary in a society controlled by tyrannical forces. The poem is passionately pantheistic and the rapture at the end seems to become identical with engulfment into nothingness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff1460f49cdf64ba880eb43e4f178e711255d3cd","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+of+Shelley+-+1+-+Samuel+West","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff1460f49cdf64ba880eb43e4f178e711255d3cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,20,96,244,156,223,100,186,136,14,180,62,79,23,142,113,18,85,211,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
