Not anymore. But what if we could turn back time, to the days of the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker? The story of the rise and fall of the great British high street is brought to life in an entertaining and ambitious new series that transports four empty shops and a group of modern shopkeepers and their families back to the birth of the high street in the 1870s, before propelling them through a century of dizzying change, right up to the 1970s. Over six hours of gripping television, the families lives are turned upside down as they experience how shopkeepers lived and worked in six key eras of British history. But this High Street is no museum.\n6)  It's the 1970s \nIn this episode it's the end of the journey for the shopkeepers and their customers as they move into the 1970s. There are two new arrivals, the Sandher family take over the general store and David Lashmar has the challenge of selling vinyl to 21st century shoppers from his 1970s record shop. A '70s boutique keeps customers abreast of fashion fads and townsfolk are soon decked out in glam rock, lounge wear and punk. Amidst the explosion of popular culture the supermarket reminds everyone of the part the 1970s played in our quest for cheap food and convenient shopping. At the cornershop the Sandher kids find out just how hard their dad worked when his family left India to set up shop in Britain and they are shocked to hear his memories of the 1970s. The record shop treats the town to a Eurovision winning band performance and all the traders prepare for a Silver Jubilee street party. The town has experienced one hundred years of high street history but will power cuts, the1970s shopping experience and the Great British weather dampen the community spirit that has built up over the years?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/2323/thehighstreetscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/2323/thehighstreetscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2633/thehighstreetscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2633/thehighstreetscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6963/thehighstreetscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6963/thehighstreetscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7945/thehighstreetscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7945/thehighstreetscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/4961/thehighstreetscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/4961/thehighstreetscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8330/thehighstreetscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8330/thehighstreetscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7234/thehighstreetscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7234/thehighstreetscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6960/thehighstreetscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6960/thehighstreetscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7429/thehighstreetscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7429/thehighstreetscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7994/thehighstreetscreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7994/thehighstreetscreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6638/thehighstreetscreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6638/thehighstreetscreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/88/thehighstreetscreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/88/thehighstreetscreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1603 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source : DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sheptonmallet.co/turnbacktime.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sheptonmallet.co/turnbacktime.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1fe7d0d8d0df4b3e49ce15ef811222e3aa5990f","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+High+Street+6of6+1970s+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1fe7d0d8d0df4b3e49ce15ef811222e3aa5990f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,254,125,13,141,13,244,179,228,156,225,94,248,17,34,46,58,165,153,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
