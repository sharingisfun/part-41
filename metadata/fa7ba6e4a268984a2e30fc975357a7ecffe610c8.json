The track listing is great, the mixing is flawless, and a single upbeat mood is maintained throughout the mix. I GREATLY recommend checking out Summer Solstice if you are just passing by.\n\nAnother mix that lightly compares to the track listing and energetic tone of this side is Sonix's &quot;Live at ETN 2005-04-03&quot;.\n\nI would reccomend that you start these mixes with Live at ETN and end it was Summer solstice if you plan on running through these in one sitting.\n\n\n\nMOST RECENT MIX:\nLiquid Courage.\nThis is another great mix by Sonix mixed with liquid D&amp;B in mind. This is a very relaxing, but energizing mix and i hope you too can enjoy it.\n\nTrivia:\nSonix's longest mix is &quot;Live on Radio Journey With Sonix Around The Globe In 12 Hours 2004-04-26&quot; and the run time for it is 12 hours, 2 minutes, and 27 seconds.\nI have yet to even hear of a mix that tops this play time.\nnot that i would be sure that i wanted it.\nI suggest playing this when afk or sleep with the music playing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7ba6e4a268984a2e30fc975357a7ecffe610c8","amp;dn":"DJ+Sonix+Discography+-+Including+Supported+Set+Lists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7ba6e4a268984a2e30fc975357a7ecffe610c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,123,166,228,162,104,152,74,46,48,252,151,83,87,167,236,255,230,16,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
