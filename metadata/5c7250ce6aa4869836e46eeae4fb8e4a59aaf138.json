Each turning point and breakthrough of modernism and postmodernism is explored in depth, as are the frequent anti-modernist reactions that proposed alternative visions of art and the world. Art Since 1900 introduces students to the key theoretical approaches to modern and contemporary art in a way that enables them to comprehend the many Ã¢â‚¬Å“voicesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of art in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. 311 full-color and 128 black-and-white illustrations.&quot;\n\nUploader's Note: Book is in the form of a pdf.
