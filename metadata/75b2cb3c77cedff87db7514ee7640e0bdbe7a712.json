At its core is a 12-bit digital delay with variable sample rate from 0 to 352 khz. The delay is controlled by a programmable processor that allows you to change and modulate the delay time with various &quot;operators&quot;. The input and output stages offers virtual analog components for saturation, limiting and filtering. The sound of Permut8 is raw and complex but noisy and warm at the same time.\n\nModulate, Manipulate and Mangle\nPermut8 is shipped with 11 &quot;program banks&quot; equalling a total of 320 presets covering a wide range of effects from traditional delays and flangers to beat-repeaters, bit-crushers and yet unheard of circuit bent madness. Use the player on the right to try some of the programs on top of a simple Microtonic beat.\n\nAlternative Firmwares\nPermut8 can be expanded with new functionality through so called &quot;alternative firmwares&quot;. These firmwares are pieces of computer code that you load into Permut8 to extend or replace its signal processing algorithms. No complicated steps are necessary to &quot;install&quot; these firmwares. Simply load a special type of Permut8 Bank file into the plug-in and it will automatically activate the new signal processing code.\n\nWith version 1.1 of Permut8 we are offering a suite of Official Firmware Banks on our download page.
