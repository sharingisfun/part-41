They are\nvarious types of settings that can change and alter a sound. With RP-AMOD you can use\nit's modulators to alter your audio in different ways.\n\nWe have added Ã¢â‚¬ËœPhaserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœFlangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœChorusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœEnsembleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœTremeloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which are classic\naudio modulation FX. What differs with RP-AMOD from these classic versions, is that you\ncan also Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtempo syncÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ them to your music, and you can use two FX at the same time in\nvarious routing configurations.
