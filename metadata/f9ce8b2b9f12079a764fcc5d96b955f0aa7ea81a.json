Focusing on the characteristics of WPC materials rather than their manufacture, this guide bridges the gap between laboratory-based research and testing and the properties WPC materials exhibit when they're used in decks, railing systems, fences, and other common applications. Complete with practical examples and case studies, this guide:\n\n    *\n\n      Describes compositions of WPC materials, including thermoplastics, cellulose fiber, minerals, additives, and their properties\n    *\n\n      Covers mechanical properties, microbial resistance, water absorption, flammability, slip resistance, thermal expansion-contraction, sensitivity to oxidation and solar radiation, and rheological properties of hot melts of WPC\n    *\n\n      Covers subjects that determine esthetics, properties, performance, and durability of wood-plastic composite products\n    *\n\n      Includes comparisons of different ASTM methods and procedures that apply to specific properties\n\nThis is a comprehensive, hands-on reference for scientists, engineers, and researchers working with wood-plastic composites in plastics and polymers, materials science, microbiology, rheology, plastic technology, and chemical engineering, as well as an outstanding text for graduate students in these disciplines. It's also an excellent resource for suppliers and WPC manufacturers, and an accessible guide for developers, homebuilders, and landscape architects who want to know more about wood-plastic composites and their performance in the real world.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 702 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley-Interscience; 1 edition (August 31, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470148918\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470148914","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ce8b2b9f12079a764fcc5d96b955f0aa7ea81a","amp;dn":"Wood-Plastic+Composites+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ce8b2b9f12079a764fcc5d96b955f0aa7ea81a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,206,139,43,159,18,7,154,118,79,204,93,150,185,85,240,170,126,168,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
