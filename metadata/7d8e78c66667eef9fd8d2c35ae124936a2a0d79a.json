But the best part comes next. Dastardly Mash, featuring nuts, raisins, and hunks of chocolate. The celebrated Heath Bar Crunch. New York Super Fudge Chunk. Oreo Mint. In addition to Ben &amp; Jerry's 11 greatest hits, here are recipes for ice creams made with fresh fruit, with chocolate, with candies and cookies, and recipes for sorbets, sundaes, and baked goods.\n\n\nBy Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield, Nancy Stevens\nPublished by Workman Publishing Company in 2012\nEPUB, Retail, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d8e78c66667eef9fd8d2c35ae124936a2a0d79a","amp;dn":"Ben+%26amp%3B+Jerry%27s+Homemade+Ice+Cream%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d8e78c66667eef9fd8d2c35ae124936a2a0d79a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,142,120,198,102,103,238,249,253,141,44,53,174,18,73,54,162,160,215,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
