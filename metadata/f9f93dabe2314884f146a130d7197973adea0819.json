It was recorded in the summer of 1974 in Los Angeles, and released later that year. It followed the commercially successful predecessor &quot;Ringo&quot;, and Starr used many of the same players, including Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, Robbie Robertson, Harry Nilsson, and producer Richard Perry. The title comes from a Liverpudlian slang phrase meaning roughly, &quot;Let's get out of here.&quot;\nHowever, while all three other Beatles had contributed to Ringo, only John Lennon contributed to Goodnight Vienna. Like &quot;Ringo&quot;, Goodnight Vienna also became a hit, though a slightly less successful one.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9f93dabe2314884f146a130d7197973adea0819","amp;dn":"Ringo+Starr+-+Goodnight+Vienna+-+Vinylrip+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9f93dabe2314884f146a130d7197973adea0819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,249,61,171,226,49,72,132,241,70,161,48,215,25,121,115,173,234,8,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
