Scaggs, Andrew W. McGraw \nEnglish | ISBN: 0813142490 | 2013 | EPUB | 184 pages | 4,6 MB\n\n\nThe Historic Kentucky Kitchen assembles more than one hundred dishes from nineteenth and twentieth-century Kentucky cooks. Deirdre A. Scaggs and Andrew W. McGraw collected recipes from handwritten books, diaries, scrapbook clippings, and out-of-print cookbooks from the University of Kentucky Libraries Special Collections to bring together a variety of classic dishes, complete with descriptions of each recipe's origin and helpful tips for the modern chef. The authors, who carefully tested each dish, provide recipe modifications and substitutions for rare and hard-to-find ingredients.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vEtEwOT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vEtEwOT.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69b1b336cf8e8a8dd3155962a077bf534cd06c6","amp;dn":"The+Historic+Kentucky+Kitchen%3A+Traditional+Recipes+for+Today%27s+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69b1b336cf8e8a8dd3155962a077bf534cd06c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,155,27,51,108,248,232,168,221,49,85,150,42,7,123,245,52,205,6,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
