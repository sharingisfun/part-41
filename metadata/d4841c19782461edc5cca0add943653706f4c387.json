She soon becomes distracted from preparing for Twilight Sparkle's birthday party, an event that she promised to attend to. Rarity, after a bit of thought, decides to attend the garden party. Rarity then writes a letter to Twilight, telling her that Opalescence had gotten sick, and therefore could not attend her birthday party. When Twilight's party is moved to Canterlot Castle, next to a fancy garden party she had just been invited to, Rarity must decide whether to continue her rising social status or stay loyal to her friends.\n\nThanks to Ponyarchive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4841c19782461edc5cca0add943653706f4c387","amp;dn":"My+Little+Pony+Friendship+is+Magic+S02E09+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4841c19782461edc5cca0add943653706f4c387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,132,28,25,120,36,97,237,197,204,160,173,217,67,101,55,6,244,195,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
