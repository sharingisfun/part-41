The program is intended for fast creation of realistic stereo versions of the images making unnecessary shooting from two close points. In spite of the fact that any photograph is only a flat projection, it nevertheless contains some information about 3D structure of the object. So, the object can be reconstructed.\n\n\n \nAbout work with 2Dto3D RedBlue Converter\n\nThe program works as follows:\n\nYou load a graphic file, convert it (all is done quite simply by pressing a single button) and receive three new figures: the red - blue color picture (it is, actually, the result and is to be looked through red - blue glasses) and two full-color images - for left and right eyes. All pictures open in separate windows of the built-in graphic editor. You can change brightness, contrast, sharpness of the images and save files in various formats.\n\n--------------------------\n\nALL SINGLE IMAGE RED/BLUE OUTPUTS ARE BLACK AND WHITE PICTURES, NO MATTER THE SOURCE. TWO SEPERATE COLOR IMAGES ARE ALSO CREATED FOR USE WITH SIDE BY SIDE VIEWERS.\n\nYOUR ANTIVIRUS MAY PICK THIS UP AS A VIRUS, BUT IT IS NOT!!!\nIF THAT IS THE CASE YOU WILL NEED TO ADD IT TO YOUR EXCEPTIONS IN ORDER TO USE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f98530c62aaf254c7d8ac86b4bf0ec29dd07c4ad","amp;dn":"2Dto3D+RedBlue+Converter+v2.5.7+-+2d+to+3d+photo+maker+cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f98530c62aaf254c7d8ac86b4bf0ec29dd07c4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,133,48,198,42,175,37,76,125,138,200,107,75,240,236,41,221,7,196,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
