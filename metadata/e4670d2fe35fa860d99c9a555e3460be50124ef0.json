Although no book based on a specific collection could claim to offer an accurate review of the history of American painting, because of inevitable gaps in any collectionÃ¢â‚¬â€as exemplified here by the slight representation of folk or naive paintingÃ¢â‚¬â€the overall breadth and strength of the Metropolitan collection are not only remarkable but also serviceable for suitably displaying the history and range of American painting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4670d2fe35fa860d99c9a555e3460be50124ef0","amp;dn":"Masterpieces+of+American+Painting+in+The+Metropolitan+Museum+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4670d2fe35fa860d99c9a555e3460be50124ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,103,13,47,227,95,168,96,217,156,154,85,94,52,96,190,80,18,78,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
