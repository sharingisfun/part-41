Years of systematic filtration (and editing wherever needed) have produced this collection. I will be update as new pieces come to my attention. This is not an extensive collection of all compositions from particular artists because I discard whatever I believe is unacceptable. I will not go into details, but the following list of characteristics may contribute to certain musics being considered undesirable:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢excessive redundancy\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢lack of polyphony\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢lack of a coda\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢sudden changes in volume\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢certain instruments dominating others in volume\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢long periods of silence between movements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢awkwardness at any point along the song\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢lack of creativity, backbone, or plot\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢devoid of imagery or other interesting features\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢possessing vocals of any kind (with rare exceptions)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢no repeat value\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢not standing out as a masterpiece in the genre for which it was intended\n\nEvery person holds his own predilections. Delete what filth you encounter.\n\nThere are certain genres where some of the above undesirables are expected, such as trance, techno, and ambient. I have done my best to reduce these. Some pieces are compressed because they offer a fleeting interest or are flawed in some potentially fixable way. Some compressed files contain the songs before editing because they may fit a niche of some sort in the future. \n\nMost files are renamed from the originals. This has advantages and disadvantages: \n\nAdvantages: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢helps trigger personalized, relevant thoughts about said musical piece\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢no annoyance or embarrassment from the artist's poor choice of title\n\nDisadvantages:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢time consuming\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢may upset a purist who recognizes these changes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢when adding to a preexisting collection, one must listen to the piece before deciding if it is a duplicate\n\nI encourage the downloader to rename and edit these musics as he sees fit. Some file extensions (.FLAC, .MOD, .IT, .OGG, .MID, .XM) will not be playable in (unmodified) proprietary music players such as iTunes or Windows Media Player. Winamp (which is freeware) will play them. \n\nThe folder organization is somewhat capricious. This will be changed in future updates. \n\nIf your .M3U does not play on a different computer because you have added/removed songs from the playlist at some point using software (as opposed to manual text editing), I have included a tutorial and a fix that laypersons can understand. Some media players offer the option to create and edit .M3U files but the programming prohibits them from making the files universal.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d3701197504c52132e829284762770b7f6c4701","amp;dn":"Organized+Emotion+v1+EXTENSIVE+nonvocal++music+selection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d3701197504c52132e829284762770b7f6c4701","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,55,1,25,117,4,197,33,50,232,41,40,71,98,119,11,127,108,71,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
