The mix of the SBD improves by\nKnockin', but Jerry stays relatively low in the mix for the rest of\nthe show; thus, having plenty of him in the AUD, allow the two sources to\nwork well together. The fact that Cleveland Music Hall is a nice sounding\nroom also helps.\n\nThis is a great show with a very tasty setlist.  The whole band is on,\nand Jerry never lets up, all the way from Melody through Tangled.\n\nThanks to everyone involved. For the FOB AUD, thanks to the person who\nrecorded it, to Dave Lisuch for the 2nd gen cassettes which Charlie Miller\ntransfered, edited and coverted to FLAC; for the SBD, thanks to whoever\nrecorded it, to Mike Lai for the original seed which jakemerc edited and\nconverted to SHN.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134ff394157cd14b70f384d9ce27c72d1d62b2d5","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+Band+-+1983-11-25+-+Cleveland+Music+Hall+in+Clevela","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134ff394157cd14b70f384d9ce27c72d1d62b2d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,79,243,148,21,124,209,75,112,243,132,217,206,39,199,45,29,98,178,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
