Adapted from the novel by Lebanese writer Elias Khoury, this ambitious film takes on the weighty goal of covering roughly fifty years of Palestinian history, from 1943 to 1994, and centers around the lives of a group of Palestinian refugees. Split into two parts: The Departure and the Return, Bab el Shams runs just under five hours, but do not let this sway you. While the length is epic-worthy, Bab el Shams is a tour de force, exposing complex storylines and individualized realities. Nasrallah not only succeeds in his large-scale recreations of demanding passages in Palestinian history, but he infuses intimate scenes with a nuanced tenderness. Told through memory and flashback, Palestinians in Bab el Shams are not just a cause but people whose undeniable will to continue is coupled with faults and weaknesses. \n\nSUBTITLES:\n\nThe only language I speak is english. :-(  I used Google Translate from the French to come up with the english subtitles.

We occupy new villages and we have just begun.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ \n\nIn some of the villages that were close to urban centres, the Jewish troops followed a policy of massacres in order to precipitate the flight of the people in the cities and towns nearby. This was the case of Nasr al-Din near Tiberias, Ayn al-Zaytun near Safad, and Tirat Haifa near Haifa. In all three of these villages, groups of men that were, in the parlance of the Hagana, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmales between the age of 10 and 50Ã¢â‚¬â„¢, were executed in order to intimidate and terrorise the village population and those living in the nearby towns.\n\nOut of the three massacres, historians do not yet have the full picture for Nasr al-Din, but the other two are well documented, the most well-known of which is Ayn al-Zaytun.\n\nAyn al-Zaytun\nAyn al-Zaytun is the best known of the three massacres because its story formed the basis for the only epic novel on the Palestinian catastrophe we have so far, Bab al-Shamsby Elias Khoury. The events in the village were also chronÃ‚Â¬icled in a semi-fictional Israeli novella on the period, Netiva Ben-YehudaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Between the Knots.  Bab al-Shams was made into a film, a French-Egyptian co-production.  The scenes on the screen closely resemble the descriptions we find in Between the Knots, which Ben-Yehuda largely based on reports in the military archives and on oral recollections. The film also faithfully repreÃ‚Â¬sents the beauty of the village, which lay in a low-lying canyon bisecting the high mountains of the Galilee on the road between Mayrun and Safad, and was graced by a stream of fresh water surrounded by hot mineral pools.\n\nThe villageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategic location, a mile west of Safad, made it an ideal tarÃ‚Â¬get for occupation. It was also coveted by local Jewish settlers, who had started buying land nearby and who maintained an uneasy relationship with the villagers towards the end of the Mandate. Operation Ã¢â‚¬ËœBroomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ proÃ‚Â¬vided a chance for the HaganaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite unit, the Palmach, not only to cleanse the village in accordance with Plan Dalet on 2 May 1948, but also to settle Ã¢â‚¬Ëœold accountsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, namely the hostility with which the Palestinian villagers had viewed and received the settlers.\n\nThe operation was entrusted to Moshe Kalman, who had already sucÃ‚Â¬cessfully supervised savage attacks on Khisas, SaÃ¢â‚¬Ëœsa and Husayniyya in the same distinct. His troops encountered very little resistance, as the Syrian volunteers positioned there left hurriedly once the shelling of the village started at dawn: heavy mortar bombardment followed by the systematic throwing of hand grenades. KalmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces entered the village towards noon. Women, children, old people and a few younger men who had not left with the Syrian volunteers came out of hiding waving a white flag. They were immediately herded into the village centre. \n\nThe film then re-enacts the search-and-arrest- in this case the search-and- execute - routine as performed by the special intelligence units of the Hagana. First, they brought in a hooded informer who scrutinised the men lined up in\n \nthe village square; those whose names appeared on a pre-prepared list the intelligence officers had brought with them were identified. The men selected were then taken to another location and shot dead. When other men rebelled or protested, they were killed as well. In one incident, which the film captured extremely well, one of the villagers, Yusuf Ahmad Hajjar, told his captors that he, like the others, had surrendered and thus Ã¢â‚¬Ëœexpected to be treated humanelyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The Palmach commander slapped him in the face and then ordered him, by way of punishment, to pick thirty-seven teenagers at random. While the rest of the villagers were forced into the storage room of the village mosque, the teenagers were shot with their hands tied behind their backs.\nIn his book, Hans Lebrecht offers another glimpse of the atrocities, and explains that Ã¢â‚¬Ëœat the end of May 1948,1 was ordered by the military unit in which I served to build a temporary pump station, and to divert the Ã¢â‚¬Å“desertedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ villageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stream, Ayn Zaytun, to supply water to the battalion. The village had been totally destroyed, and among the debris there were many bodies. In particular, we found many bodies of women, children and babies near the local mosque. I convinced the army to burn the bodiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. \nThese graphic descriptions are also found in the Hagana military reports,  but how many of Ayn al-ZaytunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s villagers were actually executed is hard to tell. The military documents reported that all in all, including the executions, seventy people had been shot; other sources give a much higher number. Netiva Ben-Yehuda was a member of the Palmach and was in the village when the execution happened, but she preferred to tell the story in a fictionalised way. However, her story offers a chilling detailed description of the way the men of the village were shot while handcuffed, giving the numÃ‚Â¬ber executed as several hundred:\nBut Yehonathan continued to yell, and suddenly he turned with his back to Meirke, and walked away furiously, all the time continuing to complain: Ã¢â‚¬ËœHe is out of his mind! Hundreds of people are lying there tied! Go and kill them! Go and waste hundreds of people! A madman kills people bound like this and only a madman wastes all the ammunition on them! ... I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know who they had in mind, who is coming to inspect them, but I understand itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become urgent, suddenly we have to untie the knots around these POWsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hands and legs, and then I realized they are all dead, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœproblem solvedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. \nAccording to this account the massacre, as we know from many other mass killings, occurred not only as Ã¢â‚¬ËœpunishmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for Ã¢â‚¬ËœimpertinenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ but also because the Hagana had as yet no POW camps for the large numbers of villagers captured. But even after such camps were set up, massacres occurred when large groups of villagers were captured, as in Tantura and Dawaymeh after 15 May 1948.\n\nOral histories, which provided Elias Khoury with the material for Bab al-Shams, also reinforce the impression that the archival material does not tell the full story: it is economical about the methods employed and misleading about the number of people killed on that fateful day in May 1948.\n\nAs noted, each village served as a precedent that would become part of a pattern and a model that then facilitated more systematic expulsions. In Ayn al-Zaytun, the villagers were taken to the edge of the village where the Jewish troops then started firing shots over their heads as they ordered them to flee. The routine procedures were followed as well: the people were stripped of all their belongings before being banished from their homeland.\n\nThe Palmach later seized the nearby village, Biriyya, and, as in Ayn al-Zaytun, ordered all the houses to be burnt in order to demoralize the Arabs of Safad.  Only two villages remained in the area. The Hagana now faced a more complicated task: how to similarly homogenize, or rather Ã¢â‚¬ËœJudaizeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the Marj Ibn Amir region and the vast plains that stretched between the valley and the River Jordan, all the way eastwards to occupied Baysan, and all the way north up to the city of Nazareth, which was still free in those days","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dacba7b8159e0310a86b2179e44d386811d2f6e4","amp;dn":"Bab+el+Shams+%282004%29+Gate+of+the+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dacba7b8159e0310a86b2179e44d386811d2f6e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,203,167,184,21,158,3,16,168,107,33,121,228,77,56,104,17,210,246,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
