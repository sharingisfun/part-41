These two albums, which are products of the same two-day session,\nreflect a recent strategy in which the master woodwind player has matched up\nwith much younger drummers who have some concepts of their own.\n\nLike drummer Mike Reed and multi-instrumentalist Weasel Walter, both of whom he\nhas played with in the past year, Kikanju Baku, the percussionist on this\nsession, is a player who makes things happen. Possessed of both manic energy\nand a fine instinct for restraint, he articulates elaborate shapes that sound\nlike they owe as much to prog rock as to any tradition of improvisation.\n\nMitchell takes to their convolution like a duck to water; his own playing is\nall sharp angles, coarse cries and pitches so acrid, they seem to have been set\nalight by BakuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ferocity. TabornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s piano runs match MitchellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lines in\nmomentum and persistence, but he also has good instincts for when to hold back;\nthere are long passages where he plays sparsely or not at all. His other\nkeyboards add subliminal textures and tonal variety without once lapsing into\nmere novelty.\n\nBoth of these CDs are remarkably consistent; the engagement and invention never\nflags, which makes it hard to favor one over the other. Honor also goes out to\nthe session engineers, Gregory Howe and Jimmy Fontana. Not only is he sound\ncrisp and immaculate, it imparts a spacial experience hat makes it feel like\nthe music is happening all around the listener.\n\n--\n\nBy Josh Campbell &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/02/roscoe-mitchellcraig-tabornkikanju-baku.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/02/roscoe-mitchellcraig-tabornkikanju-baku.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby S.
