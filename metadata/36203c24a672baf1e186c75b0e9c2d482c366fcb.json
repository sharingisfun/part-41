Nov-30-69. Controversial and rare TV show containing in-studio rehearsal and recording, road travel, political viewpoints, concert performances and video montages of key events of the 1960s. \n\nThe program was originally to be a &quot;Bell Telephone&quot; TV special but when they saw the finished product they said, &quot;No!&quot; When video images of JFK, RFK and MLK were shown while &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters&quot; played, the Bell Telephone executives commented, &quot;They're all democrats, why no republicans?&quot; Simon &amp; Garfunkel said, &quot;Is that what you see? How about they were all assassinated?&quot; Simon &amp; Garfunkel met with CBS and they sympathized with the content and agreed to air the program. \n\nSongs include: &quot;America,&quot; &quot;So Long Frank Lloyd Wright,&quot; &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters,&quot; &quot;Scarborough Fair, &quot; &quot;El Condor Pasa (If I Could),&quot; &quot;Punky's Dilemma,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Robinson,&quot; &quot;Mystery Train,&quot; &quot;Feeling Groovy,&quot; &quot;The Boxer,&quot; &quot;Homeward Bound,&quot; &quot;Sounds Of Silence,&quot; and several others. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36203c24a672baf1e186c75b0e9c2d482c366fcb","amp;dn":"SIMON+AND+GARFUNKEL+%26ndash%3B+SONGS+OF+AMERICA+1969+-+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36203c24a672baf1e186c75b0e9c2d482c366fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,32,60,36,166,114,186,241,225,134,199,91,14,156,45,72,44,54,111,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
