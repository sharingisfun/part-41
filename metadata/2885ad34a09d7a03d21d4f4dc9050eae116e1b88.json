Legendary for their bravery and dedication, the Templars became one of the wealthiest and most powerful bodies of the medieval world--and the chief defenders against the growing Muslim military campaign to reimpose foreign rule on a Christian society.\n\nIn The Tragedy of the Templars, historian Michael Haag explores the rise and fall of the Templars against the background story of the Crusader venture in the Holy Land, which even after four centuries of Muslim occupation had remained a predominantly Christian community with whom settlers from the West intermarried and created a distinctive civilization.\n\nA stirring work of historical investigation, The Tragedy of the Templars masterfully details the conflicts and betrayals that sent the Knights Templar spiraling from domination and power to being burned alive at the stake.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2885ad34a09d7a03d21d4f4dc9050eae116e1b88","amp;dn":"The+Tragedy+of+the+Templars++%282013+-+epub+%26amp%3B+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2885ad34a09d7a03d21d4f4dc9050eae116e1b88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,133,173,52,160,157,122,3,210,29,79,77,201,5,14,174,17,110,27,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
