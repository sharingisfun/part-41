Blow Out (but I've never heard anybody use that title)\n\nThe first time I saw it I thought I'd lost my appetite.  The second time, dragging some friends, I was insatiable after the film was over.\n\nA cast to die for.  Marcello Mastoianni, Michel Piccoli, Ugo Tognazzi, Philipe Noiret. I'd die to have been part of the cast. Even as a vegetarian, I'd have loved to have come with the meat wagon.\n\nUncompressed PAL VIDEO_TS files with culinary extras.\n\nJust try to enjoy it more than me.\n\nThanks to the original uploader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3089a8d1008800230f024dd79424a2b5ce5efce7","amp;dn":"Marco+Ferreri+-+La+Grande+Bouffe+-+1973","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3089a8d1008800230f024dd79424a2b5ce5efce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,137,168,209,0,136,0,35,15,2,77,215,148,36,162,181,206,94,252,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
