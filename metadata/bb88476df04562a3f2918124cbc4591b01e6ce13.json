Unique Science Applied boxes answer the questions about how we learn what we know about the science of nutrition and why knowledge changes. Critical Thinking exercises included in each chapter allow them to learn the basics of how to think about a problem or situation creatively and critically. A case study is also included in each chapter that builds interest in the material. Each chapter then concludes with a postscript that solidifies the nutritionistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ understanding of the links between the science and application.\nFrom the Back Cover\nTHE CHOICE IS YOURS\n\nIce cream or sorbet, red meat or fish, fruits or pastries, eggs or oatmeal-our lives are filled with choices about what we eat.  That's why Lori Smolin and Mary Grosvenor's Nutrition: Science and Applications, 4/E helps you understand how to analyze nutritional information and apply your knowledge to the nutrition issues you face each and every day.\n\nNow updated to include the new Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) published in the fall of 2002, the Fourth Edition offers new and expanded coverage of such cutting-edge nutritional topics as the relationship between genetics and body weight regulation and the ecological impact of genetically modified foods and organic food production. In addition, this edition features a new chapter, Meeting Nutrient Needs: Food Versus Supplements, which discusses the benefits and drawbacks of meeting nutritional needs with foods, fortified foods, and supplements, as well as the role of herbal supplements.\n\nTo enhance your experience learning about nutrition, be sure to visit the book companion website at www.wiley.com/college/smolin --This text refers to the Paperback edition.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 936 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 2 edition (January 5, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 047052474X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470524749","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb88476df04562a3f2918124cbc4591b01e6ce13","amp;dn":"Nutrition+-+Science+and+Applications+2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb88476df04562a3f2918124cbc4591b01e6ce13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,136,71,109,240,69,98,163,242,145,129,36,203,196,89,27,1,230,206,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
