The comic debuted with FantaCo in 1981, and in 1985 was revived by Eclipse, where (starting over from issue 1) it ran for fourteen issues until 1987. Eclipse began publishing the title soon after the cancellation of Alien Worlds, a similar science-fiction themed anthology.\n\nSeveral noteworthy creators worked on the series, including Stephen R. Bissette, John Bolton, joe Chiodo, Richard Corben, Howard Cruse, Chuck Dixon, Rick Geary, Bruce Jones, David Lloyd, David Mazzucchelli, Gray Morrow, Timothy Truman, Thomas Yeates, and Mike Zeck. Catherine Yronwode edited Alien Encounters for Eclipse, which was noted for its racy, pulp magazine-inspired covers, and was sometimes criticized for featuring gratuitous nude scenes.\n\nThis torrent contains all of the above.
