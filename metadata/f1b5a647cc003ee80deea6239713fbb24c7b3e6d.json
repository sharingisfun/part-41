Included on Clemons' album Hero of that year, it began with a saxophone blast by the E Streeter and continued in a cheery, up-tempo frame with declarations of you can depend on me and the like as the two traded couplets. Bolstered by the huge popularity of Bruce Springsteen at the time, the song was a decent success commercially, making the Top 20 of pop (#18), rock (#16), and adult contemporary (#21) charts in the U.S. The music video for &quot;You're a Friend of Mine&quot; featured then-Browne girlfriend Darryl Hannah painting watercolors on a sofa as Clemons, Browne, and a backing band worked through the number.\n\nClarence Clemons (born January 11, 1942) nicknamed The Big Man, is an American musician, best known as the saxophonist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.\n\nClyde Jackson Browne (born October 9, 1948) is an American rock singer-songwriter and musician. His introspective lyrics made him the poster boy of the Southern California confessional singer-songwriter movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 2004, Browne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by fellow American musical artist and good friend, Bruce Springsteen. In the same year, Browne received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Los Angeles' Occidental College for &quot;a remarkable musical career that has successfully combined an intensely personal artistry with a broader vision of social change and justice&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1b5a647cc003ee80deea6239713fbb24c7b3e6d","amp;dn":"Clarence+Clemons+And+Jackson+Browne+-+You%5C%27re+A+Friend+Of+Mine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1b5a647cc003ee80deea6239713fbb24c7b3e6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,181,166,71,204,0,62,232,13,238,166,35,151,19,251,178,76,123,62,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
