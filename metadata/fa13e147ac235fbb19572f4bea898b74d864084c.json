After presenting an overview of the environments and conditions space robots have to work in, the author discusses a variety of manipulatory devices robots may use to perform their tasks. This is followed by a discussion of robot mobility in these environments and the various technical approaches. The last two chapters are dedicated to actuators, sensors and power systems used in space robots. This book fills a gap in the space technology literature and will be useful for students and for those who have an interest in the broad and highly interdisciplinary field of space robotics, and in particular in its mechanical aspects.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 618 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 2012 edition (September 23, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9400717954\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9400717954","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa13e147ac235fbb19572f4bea898b74d864084c","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+the+Mechanics+of+Space+Robots+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa13e147ac235fbb19572f4bea898b74d864084c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,19,225,71,172,35,95,187,25,87,47,75,234,137,139,116,216,100,8,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
