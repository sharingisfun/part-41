It does this by leveraging some very cool automated content acquisition software, then makes it available via two powerful library managers, Plex and Madsonic (a Subsonic mod). Using a Linux Mint base, it is a remix of the popular OS enabling the [Flawless] Server to directly benefit from their solid and stable approach to Linux development.\nWhat is a Cloud Media Server?\n\n    Massive Storage (Local/Cloud) - Tons of storage on a singular volume to hold everything you have (movies, music, tv shows, pictures, files, programs, PC backups, phone backups, etc).  \n    Automated Acquisition - Easily and automatically grow your media library with movies, music, tv shows, etc, through the use of some awesome programs.\n    Agnostic Distribution - Windows, Apple, Linux, Android, iOS, PS3, Set-top, Stream, DLNA, local.
