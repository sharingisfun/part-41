She has a pedigree that rivals some of her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best horses. Other than feeling a little suffocated at times, Cami thought she was pretty happy with her boyfriend, her life and her future.\n\nBut that was before she met Patrick Henley.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“TrickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ blurs the lines between what Cami wants and what is expected of her. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s considered the Ã¢â‚¬Å“help,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is forbidden fruit as far as her father is concerned, not to mention that Trick would be fired if he ever laid a hand on her. And Trick needs his job. Desperately. His family depends on him.\n\nThe heart wants what the heart wants, though, and Trick and Cami are drawn to each other despite the obstacles. At least the ones they know of.\n\nWhen Trick stumbles upon a note from his father, it triggers a series of revelations that could ruin what he and Cami have worked so hard to overcome. It turns out thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to TrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence at the ranch than either of them knew, secrets that could tear them apart.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee1cfcd504e4811196228d7f878657bcd6a27a4","amp;dn":"The+Wild+Ones+by+M.+Leighton+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee1cfcd504e4811196228d7f878657bcd6a27a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,225,207,205,80,78,72,17,25,98,40,215,248,120,101,123,205,106,39,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
