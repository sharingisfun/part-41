The reason? Sheer ballsy ecelecticism. Who else would follow up Strauss with speed metal? Or big band music with rockabilly? Yet it somehow all makes sense, creating an almost indescribable atmosphere that's at once totally intense and totally cool. In a perfect world, radio would always sound like this: An uber-hip DJ picking songs not because they *sound* appropriate together... but because they *feel* appropriate together.\nWorth mentioning are Chris Isaac's two contributions here, in my opinion among his best-ever songs. There's the hit &quot;Wicked Game,&quot; of course, but &quot;Big Blue Spanish Sky&quot; drips mystery and melancholy in a pretty wonderful way. Longtime Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti's requisite instrumental contributions seem to key off Isaac's vibe.\nOne drawback: you get Nicholas Cage singing not one, but two Elvis tunes. He's not as good as Elvis.\nAmazon Review by tokyo111\n\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Soudtrack\nQuality: [FLAC+.cue ]\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Gewandhausorchester Leipzig - Richard Strauss: Im Abendrot (01:48)\n02 - Powermad - Slaughterhouse (05:22)\n03 - Angelo Badalamenti and Kinny Landrum - Cool Cat Walk (03:26)\n04 - Nicolas Cage - Love Me (02:57)\n05 - Them - Baby Please Don't Go (02:41)\n06 - Koko Taylor - Up In Flames (06:15)\n07 - Chris Isaak - Wicked Game (04:05)\n08 - Gene Vincent &amp; The Blue Caps - Be-Bop-A-Lula (02:38)\n09 - Glen Gray and The Casa Loma Orchestra - Smoke Rings (03:03)\n10 - Rubber City - Perdita (04:13)\n11 - Chris Isaak - Blue Spanish Sky (03:59)\n12 - Angelo Badalamenti and Kinny Landrum - Dark Spanish Symphony (Edited - String Version) (02:36)\n13 - Rubber City - Dark Spanish Symphony (50's Version) (02:43)\n14 - Angelo Badalamenti and Kinny Landrum - Dark Lolita (02:16)\n15 - Nicolas Cage - Love Me Tender (02:59)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb33520c2c4b52d391b1f719cb6e5cfc0b050c5b","amp;dn":"%281990%29+Angelo+Badalamenti+-+Wild+At+Heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb33520c2c4b52d391b1f719cb6e5cfc0b050c5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,51,82,12,44,75,82,211,145,177,247,25,203,110,92,252,11,5,12,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
