GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Velasco, &quot;Journey through Mathematics: Creative Episodes in Its History&quot;\nPublisher: Springer | 2011 | ISBN: 0387921532 | English | PDF | 475 pages | 5.15 Mb\n\nThis book offers an accessible and in-depth look at some of the most important episodes of two thousand years of mathematical history. Beginning with trigonometry and moving on through logarithms, complex numbers, infinite series, and calculus, this book profiles some of the lesser known but crucial contributors to modern day mathematics. It is unique in its use of primary sources as well as its accessibility; a knowledge of first-year calculus is the only prerequisite. But undergraduate and graduate students alike will appreciate this glimpse into the fascinating process of mathematical creation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e322635a5854674423727815633f4f7e37176c","amp;dn":"Journey+through+Mathematics%3A+Creative+Episodes+in+Its+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e322635a5854674423727815633f4f7e37176c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,227,34,99,90,88,84,103,68,35,114,120,21,99,63,79,126,55,23,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
