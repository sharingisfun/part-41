Hold On\n\n\nSeryn is a 5 piece band who calls Denton, Texas their home. When listening to the well layered textures of guitars, ukulele, accordion, bass, viola, banjo and various percussion, it's hard to imagine This Is Where We Are is the band's debut effort. The band's strength resides in their vast musical talent and understanding of dynamics. Their beauty is gracefully displayed through chilling harmonies. Each member and their voice carry the same importance. One is not complete without the other.\n\nIt is in this craft that the young band shines so bright. It has earned them a sound that isn't easily defined, but still proven triumphant. What may first appear as straight folk songs, later transcend into menacing walls of sound. The term &quot;Folk-Pop&quot; has been thrown around and maybe it loosely fits, but we will leave the definitions up to you.\n\nThe Denton Record-Chronicle said &quot;Seryn's set was so dynamic that you could feel the key changes in your feet, through Festival HallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concrete floor!&quot;. While the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported, &quot;Watching Seryn perform, it's hard to convince yourself that those crystalline, multi-part harmonies are not pre-recorded or some kind of sleight of ear.&quot; You can see where this is going...\n\nThis is Where We Are was produced by Britton Beisenherz (Ramble Creek), and recorded over the course of a few months. The experience felt at their live show seems to be captured well in these recordings, which was something of great importance to the band. The band has created their own buzz in the most traditional way too by winning people over at their shows. It's not often that a band without a record out is able to play so many great bills and sold out shows. Much less, be nominated for awards such as Best Folk Artist, and Song of the Year (Dallas Observer). There is no shortage of regional press on them either but the band is excited to take their sound, their show, and their new record on the road. They will be traveling all over the US in the coming months. Go see them play and you will be sucked in!\n\n&quot;Beautiful arrangements (both in instrumentation and in vocal harmonies) and an epic, &quot;big sky&quot; sound that, at times, seems more fitting washing over dilapidated wooden pews in an old church than the usual torn-up couches, vinyl booths and barstools of area venues.&quot; - Dallas Observer\n\n&quot;Like ice-cold water on a hot day, their music is crisp and refreshing, and I cannot get enough. The imagery packed into their set is unreal. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like listening to the soundtrack of a great love story, breathtaking drama, and a dark tragedy all rolled into one over-the-top, unparalleled performance.&quot; - My Denton Music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f7cd9f8fef1a5d7654b213a79f1da7db3fa078d","amp;dn":"Seryn+-+This+Is+Where+We+Are+%5B2011%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f7cd9f8fef1a5d7654b213a79f1da7db3fa078d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,124,217,248,254,241,165,215,101,75,33,58,121,241,218,125,179,250,7,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
