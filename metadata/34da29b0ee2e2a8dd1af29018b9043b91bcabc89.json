It then organizes those snaps into a library where you can tag, rate and comment them.\n\nIt also comes with some built-in vector tools that allow you to mark up your images with text, callouts, shapes, lines, arrows, blurs and highlighting. Best of all, the annotations are all non-destructive allowing you to hide and show them at a moment's notice.\n\nThen share the snaps with your clients colleagues and friends. To make that possible, we've built in support for Flickr, image exports, FTP, SFTP and our own web service especially for LittleSnapper users: QuickSnapper.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Area snapping no longer includes grab-handles on Mac OS X Lion\n\n* Minor tweaks and enhancements.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS version: Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34da29b0ee2e2a8dd1af29018b9043b91bcabc89","amp;dn":"Little+Snapper+v.+1.8.1+with+core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34da29b0ee2e2a8dd1af29018b9043b91bcabc89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,218,41,176,238,46,42,141,209,175,41,1,139,144,67,185,27,202,188,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
