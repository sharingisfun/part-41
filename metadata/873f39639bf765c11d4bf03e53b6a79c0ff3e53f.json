From the very first notes, you're sucked into jazz history,\nfull of Africa, full of blues, with the interplay and the soloing of the highest\nlevel throughout. Adam Lane writes in the liner notes that &quot;this is fun music,\ndesigned to uplift the spirit and bring the listener and performer to a more\njoyful place than they (we) were before&quot;, and believe, it more than delivers on\nthat objective.\n\nThe band is Adam Lane on bass, Avram Fefer on alto sax, David Bindman on tenor\nand soprano sax, Matt Bauder on tenor and baritone sax, Igal Foni on drums, Reut\nRegev and Tim Vaughn on trombone, Taylor Ho Bynum and Nate Wooley on trumpet.\n\nThe themes are compelling, starting with funeral march-like first piece,\n&quot;Imaginary Portrait&quot;, with African influences as on &quot;Marshall&quot;, or Ellingtonian\nas on &quot;Nine Man Morris&quot;, but the blues is all-pervasive, with great highlights\nin the quieter parts, as on the duet between Lane and Nate Wooley in the first\npiece, or Lane's intro to &quot;Desperate Incantations&quot;. Despite the composed parts,\nthe larger part of the music is improvised, over structural and rhythmic\ncells. Two of the compositions, &quot;Ashcan Rantings&quot;, and &quot;Lucia&quot; already figured\non Lane's &quot;Four Corners&quot; CD.\n\nThe solos are wild at times, bringing the music far beyond any concept a big\nband might have, with sometimes two or three musicians overlapping. giving\nexpansive and expressive power to the already strong drive and pulse.\n\nLane himself is in full control of what is happening with his bass underpinning\neverything without limiting the band. The sound quality of the bass is\nabsolutely exceptional too, with a kind of forefront presence that works really\nwell.\n\nThe great paradox about this magnificent music is like the blues itself : it\nsounds so sad and melancholic at moment, so sweeping with &quot;weltschmerz&quot;,\nsometimes so full of distress and anger, but the totality is so deeply emotional\nand full of joy that it's hard to describe. Lane's gut-wrenching and\nheart-rending intro of the title track says it all. The only piece that is\njoyful by itself is the last one, &quot;Bright Star Calyspo&quot; (sic), which collapses\ninto wild and rhythmless soloing, before bringing the album to its great\nfinale.\n\nAnd it all fits, and there are no weak moments, not in the compositions (some of\nthem, like &quot;Mahler&quot; will stick to your brain for a while), not in the interplay,\nnot in the soloing. And you get your money's worth on top with this double-CD's\nmore than ninety minutes of absolute musical delight. Adam Lane knows and feels\nand lives music. So far, all of his albums were among my favorites of the year,\nbut this one is superb.\n\nMan, man, man - this is music I will still listen to with joy in a couple of\ndecades and recommend to my great-grand-children. (They will for once stop\nlistening to the electronic rhythmic bleeps that some new device will integrate\ndirectly in the auditory part of their brains, they will for once stop being\ntotally disinterested in the ashcan rantings of their great-grandfather and\nlisten in awe to the great acoustic music of the past).\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n--\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\n\nBy Chris Monsen\n\nBy Jose Carlos Fernandes (pt)\n\nPor Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/11/03/adam-lane%E2%80%99s-full-throttle-orchestra-ashcan-rantings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/11/03/adam-lane%E2%80%99s-full-throttle-orchestra-ashcan-rantings/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Cayetano LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez (es)\n\nPor Ricardo Arribas (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jazzitis.com/web/content/ashcan-rantings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jazzitis.com/web/content/ashcan-rantings&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873f39639bf765c11d4bf03e53b6a79c0ff3e53f","amp;dn":"Adam+Lane%5C%27s+Full+Throttle+Orchestra+-+Ashcan+Rantings+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873f39639bf765c11d4bf03e53b6a79c0ff3e53f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,63,57,99,155,247,101,193,29,75,240,62,83,182,167,156,15,243,229,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
