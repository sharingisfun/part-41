Much more than a war memoir, Dust to Dust brilliantly explores the passage through a lifetimeÃ¢â‚¬â€a moving meditation on life and death, the adventures of childhood and revelations of adulthood. Seemingly ordinary things take on a breathtaking radiance when examined by this decorated Marine officerÃ¢â‚¬â€veteran of two combat tours in IraqÃ¢â‚¬â€actor on the hit HBO series The Wire, and son of acclaimed novelist Frederick Busch. Above all, Benjamin Busch is a truly extraordinary new literary talent as evidenced by his exemplary debut, Dust to DustÃ¢â‚¬â€an original, emotionally powerful, and surprisingly refreshing take on an American soldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a770d9d3424528f2d127c5d4d7483178b5177c7","amp;dn":"Dust+to+Dust+-+A+Memoir+-+Benjamin+Busch+-+Epub%2BMobi+-+Yeal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a770d9d3424528f2d127c5d4d7483178b5177c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,119,13,157,52,36,82,143,45,18,124,93,77,116,131,23,139,81,119,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
