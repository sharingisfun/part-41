People suddenly \nfound themselves in a completely different situation and this instantly influenced \nthe Blues, the electric style, developed earlier on in Electric Memphis and Texas \nBlues, remained, however became harder and edgier, instruments like the saxophone \nwere incorporated into the music and gave this new hybrid a sometimes jazzy feel. \n\nOnce again, the lyric themes shifted away from known territory and began to reflect \nthe changed situation, drugs, alcohol, sex, women, money gained major importance, \nlife in wintery ghettos and anonymous housing schemes contributed its share: Chicago \nBlues was born.\n__________\n\n 1.
