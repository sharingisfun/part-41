She achieved success in her early career as an R&amp;B star, but smoothly changed her repertoire toward a more jazz orientated musical style in the early 90s.\n\nNatalie Cole is the daughter of noted crooner Nat King Cole and Maria Cole, former singer with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. Cole was raised in the affluent Hancock Park district of Los Angeles, just a few doors down from the California governor.\n\nCole may be best remembered for her 1991 album, Unforgettable... with Love, featuring her own arrangements of her father&amp;#039;s greatest hits. Though when she was younger, Cole was reluctant to capitalize on her father&amp;#039;s name and wanted to forge her own identity by going after the soul market in earnest, on this album she admitted to being Nat King Cole&amp;#039;s daughter and pledged her complete devotion to her father and his music. She said that she &quot;felt&quot; his presence while recording. She sang 20 songs from Nat King Cole&amp;#039;s collection. Singles included &quot;The Very Thought of You,&quot; &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; and &quot;Route 66.&quot; The most fascinating song on the album was &quot;Unforgettable.&quot; With a little help from technology, Cole performed the song as a duet with her father using her father&amp;#039;s original recording.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89415f7834da8fe233f71cf7d9cd6a4e460c6cd0","amp;dn":"Natalie+Cole+-+The+Christmas+Song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89415f7834da8fe233f71cf7d9cd6a4e460c6cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,65,95,120,52,218,143,226,51,247,28,247,217,205,106,78,70,12,108,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
