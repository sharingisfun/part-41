GET THE TORRENT FILE BY DOWNLOADING THIS TORRENT OF THE TORRENT, AND THEN USE THAT TO DOWNLOAD THE COMICS.\n\nOR YOU COULD GO TO ONE OF THE OTHER TWO SITES IT&quot;S POSTED AT. TPB WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO POST THOSE NAMES DIRECTLY,  BUT THEY ARE -h-3-3-t-dot-com- and -d-e-m-o-n-o-i-d-dot-me\n\n\nBy my calendar (which I just made up) this is the 13th second of the 13th minute of the 13th hour of the 13th day in the 13th month of the 13th year of the 13th century. &quot;The second of the 7 13s.&quot; 1313/13/13 13:13:13  But only seven. Not enough. But I am also four 13s of years + three 13s of months + three 13s of days + three 13s of (elastic time unit I just made up) old. That's thirteen 13s. I am not making this up.  And it's Friday.\n\nThe day prophesied for my return. Prophesied by me. Just now. I am not making this up. Oh, wait. I'm being told I just made this up. And now for something completely similar.\n\nA long Time Ago, On A Torrent Site Far Far AwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\tFor nearly fifty torrents and extras, I was the guardian of alphabetical DC in the Galaxy with the More Than Complete DC project.\n\t(Onand demonoid - only a few made it here. I quit torrenting after that)\n\n\tIt seems a long time ago, though it's just been about 2 and a half years. The torrent servers are far, far away from me, so what I said was true - from a certain point of view.\n\n\tBut my project was not truly complete as I shall explain.\n\n\tNow I have come back, to complete my destiny.\n\nMTCDC-NMC - More Than Complete DC-NowÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â More Completerer!\n\nI was reluctant to return, but I soon knew it is too late for me, friend. You don't know the POWER of the sharing side. I MUST upload these comics.\n\n\tThis will be a year long remembered. It has seen the end of my retirement, it will soon see the end of my sanity.\nMay the speed force be with me.\n\nSo here it is. A series bigger than the MTCDC .\n\nTorrent One.\n\n0-Alk - Minus Action, Adventure(s)\n\nAction and Adventure are the next 2 torrents, third is several titles beginning with &quot;Adventures&quot;.\n\nWhat is this?\n\tThis is not a chronology, but alphabetical. If you want things in chronological order, go to to the DC chronology. It's not a competition. When the chronology 2.0 starts, it will be a great thing for DC fans. But if you just want a Bunch of Batman, Worship Wonder Woman, are Starry Eyed for Starman, want to Team up with the Titans, Just like the Justice League. Love the Legion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. I'll spare you any more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ you can do that more easily with an alphabetical version. Plus the Pre-DC and Post-DC are not in the DC chronology. (see below)\n\n\tThis will be every scanned comic that was published/distributed by DC Including all the other names it put on covers instead of DC. Thats's mostly the same list as the chronology, but perhaps not exactly. A partial list of imprints is Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines (Mad Magazine). Some were not actually produced by DC, just distributed. I have seen up to 46 different names listed but many of these are picky distinctions and are regular DC to most people.\n\tI'll include most alternate covers, but not look hard for them. If I have 3 covers but the there are 4, I'm too lazy to even find out what name I should search for it under. Strong I am with the sharing, but not that strong. Many are in with the comics themselves, but not all are so labeled. I also am not going to worry about covers from TPB and HC reprints, though again I have most, at least in small form. \n\n\tIt will include many related comics such as comics in which characters appeared before they were published by DC, aka &quot;Pre-DC&quot;, and occasionally &quot;Post-DC&quot;. There's a lot more of this sort of thing than you might think. Major Pre-DC characters include Blackhawk, Plastic Man, Blue Beetle and Captain Marvel (aka Shazam!) Many lessor DC figures and titles also started Pre-DC. Many things that aren't mainstream DC Universe (e.g. Loony Tunes. StarTrek) will have earlier appearances included. Even I don't know the full list yet.\n\tPlus anything else related I think worthy of tossing in. Books about DC, Trading Cards, Parodies, all kinds of miscellaneous stuff. \n \n\tSo it's the complete DC, and yet much more.\n\nWhat's different than the MTCDC \n\tMTCDC only had such parts of the imprints as contained mainstream DC characters. MTCDC-NMC has all of them. That also pulls in more Pre-DC such as a lot of Image comics that became DC-Wildstorm.\n\n\tMany comics had never been scanned last time have been now. Dozens? A couple hundred? I didn't keep track. I have many hundreds - over 2000 for sure, of newly cover to cover or otherwise improved scans. I don't have a list of which are changed. Over a year of new comics have come out (about 1300), and I'll keep up with those during the series in supplements.\n\n\tI put fills, corrections and updates separate update torrents, not a little bit in each torrent as in the MTCDC.\n \n\tAbove all other things that are new, I will have to do this without my friend, colleague and Master-Comics-Finder the late, great DieSmurfDie. Oh he's not dead, not yet. But he hasn't gone by the name of Die-Smurf-Die for a long time, a long time. \n\nSome Notes:\n\n\tI crave error or omission reports! \n\n\tI'll definitely consider suggestions for improvement. But ultimately - for sixteen hundred days, comics have I shared, my own counsel will I keep.\n\n\tI use the Phantom Stranger's list of scanned DC, over 36,000 items. If I can't find an item, then I will claim he is wrong about it. I use other lists for non-DC. I'll make a good faith effort to find those, but some non-DC may prove elusive. \n\n\tThe title is what the indica says it is. (the fine print at the front or back of the comic). This may not match the cover. This may not be what you are used to calling it. I will make some exceptions where just a few issues differ to keep the title together. I'll include those small deviations twice so if someone looks in the project for an exact title, it will be there. \nPeople disagree on how to figure volume numbers. Publisher's numbers are contradictory and just plain whacked at times. Mine, with few exceptions, are from the DC scanned list. \n\n\tTorrents will mostly be c.10-13gb but some single titles e.g. Action, Detective, are c. 20gb It should be 68-70 torrents plus the updates. Ic. 750-800gb in all. Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.\n\n\tYou need to go buy a 1 Terabyte drive or 200 DVDs. Actually buy 400 DVDs or two drives. DVDs fail. All drives die. Are you really going to lose all that when the drive inevitably fails? It's when not if. You must back up! I keep two backups of my DC. It would be very hard to get all this again. Many sources have dried up. You, must learn the ways of storage, if you are to come with me to DC land.\n\n\t Go ahead, I'll wait. \n\n\nSo we begin\n\n0-Alk - Minus Action, Adventure(s)[/color][/b]\n\nHere's the list - many have specials or such not specifically listed, but included.\n \n100 Bullets (Vertigo\n100% (Vertigo\n100% True (Paradox\n1st Issue Special v1\n2020 Visions (Vertigo\n21 Down (WS(11-2002ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®11-2003)\n3D Batman 36p (1966).cbr\n50 Who Made DC Great (1985).cbr\n52\n52 Aftermath-The Four Horsemen 01-06 (2007-2008)\n52-World War III 01-04 (06-2007)\n80 Page Giant 01-15 (1964-1965)\n9-11 including non-DC issue\nABC A-Z-Greyshirt and Cobweb (2005).cbr\nABC A-Z-Terra Obscura and Splash Brannigan 001 (2006).cbr\nABC A-Z-Tom Strong and Jack B.
