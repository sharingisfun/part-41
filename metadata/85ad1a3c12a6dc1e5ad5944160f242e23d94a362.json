In late 2001, Kapranos and Hardy had begun working on music together when they met McCarthy, a classically trained pianist and double bass player who originally played drums for the group despite no prior experience as a drummer. The trio had been rehearsing at McCarthy&amp;#039;s house for a while when they met and started playing with Thomson, a former drummer for the Yummy Fur who felt like playing guitar instead. Eventually, McCarthy and Thomson switched to guitar and drums, and the band switched practice spaces, stumbling upon an abandoned warehouse that they named the Chateau.\nThe Chateau became Franz Ferdinand&amp;#039;s headquarters, where they rehearsed and held rave-like events incorporating music and art (Hardy graduated from the Glasgow School of Art, and Thomson also posed as a life model there). The bandmembers needed a new rehearsal space once their illicit art parties were discovered by the police, and they found one in a Victorian courthouse and jail. By summer 2002, they recorded an EP&amp;#039;s worth of material that they intended to release themselves, but word of mouth about the band spread and Franz Ferdinand signed to Domino in the summer of 2003. The group&amp;#039;s EP Darts of Pleasure, which led some to label Franz Ferdinand &quot;the Scottish Interpol,&quot; was released that fall, and the band spent the rest of the year supporting groups such as Hot Hot Heat and Interpol. Franz Ferdinand&amp;#039;s second single, Take Me Out, arrived in early 2004. The single propelled them to greater popularity in the U.K. and laid the groundwork for the band&amp;#039;s debut album. Franz Ferdinand was released in February 2004 in the U.K. and a month later stateside. Franz Ferdinand&amp;#039;s success followed them across the pond; &quot;Take Me Out&quot; became a sizeable modern rock hit, in part thanks to the song&amp;#039;s cutting-edge video, which earned the Breakthrough Video award at that year&amp;#039;s MTV Music Video Awards. The group&amp;#039;s momentum continued with the release of the Michael single and their Mercury Prize win over such artists as the Streets, Basement Jaxx, and Keane. Franz Ferdinand released their second album, You Could Have It So Much Better in fall 2005.\n\nReview\tby Heather Phares\n\nWhile the Darts of Pleasure EP proved that Franz Ferdinand had a way with equally sharp lyrics and hooks, and the &quot;Take Me Out&quot; single took their sound to dramatic new heights, their self-titled debut album offers the most expansive version of their music yet. From the first track, &quot;Jacqueline,&quot; which begins with a brooding acoustic prelude before jumping into a violently vibrant celebration of hedonism, Franz Ferdinand is darker and more diverse than the band&amp;#039;s previous work suggested. &quot;Auf Ausche&quot; has an unsettling aggression underneath its romantic yearning, its cheap synth strings and pianos underscoring its low-rent moodiness and ruined glamour. And even in the album&amp;#039;s context, &quot;Take Me Out&quot; remains unmatched for sheer drama; with its relentless stomp and lyrics like &quot;I&amp;#039;m just a cross hair/I&amp;#039;m just a shot away from you,&quot; it&amp;#039;s deliciously unclear whether it&amp;#039;s about meeting a date or a firing squad. The wonderfully dry wit the band employed on Darts of Pleasure&amp;#039;s &quot;Shopping for Blood&quot; and &quot;Van Tango&quot; is used more subtly: the oddly radiant &quot;Matinee&quot; captures romantic escapism via dizzying wordplay. &quot;Michael,&quot; meanwhile, is a post-post-punk &quot;John, I&amp;#039;m Only Dancing,&quot; by equal turns macho and fey; when Alex Kapranos proclaims &quot;This is what I am/I am a man/So come and dance with me, Michael,&quot; it&amp;#039;s erotic as well as homoerotic. Love and lust make up a far greater portion of Franz Ferdinand than any of the band&amp;#039;s other work; previously, Franz Ferdinand&amp;#039;s strong suit was witty aggressiveness, and the shift in focus has mixed results. There&amp;#039;s something a little too manic and unsettled about Franz Ferdinand to make them completely convincing romantics, but &quot;Come On Home&quot; has swooning, anthemic choruses guaranteed to melt even those who hate swooning, anthemic choruses. Fortunately, the album includes enough of their louder, crazier songs to please fans of their EPs. &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; remains one of the best expressions of Franz Ferdinand&amp;#039;s shabby glamour, campy humor, and sugar-buzz energy, and &quot;Tell Her Tonight,&quot; which debuted on the Darts of Pleasure EP, returns in a full-fledged version that&amp;#039;s even more slinky, menacing, and danceable than the demo hinted it might be. And if Franz Ferdinand&amp;#039;s aim has always been to get people dancing, then &quot;Cheating on You&quot;&amp;#039;s churned-up art punk and close, Merseybeat-like harmonies suggest some combination of slam dancing and the twist that could sweep dancefloors. Despite its slight unevenness, Franz Ferdinand ends up being rewarding in different ways than the band&amp;#039;s previous work was, and it&amp;#039;s apparent that they&amp;#039;re one of the more exciting groups to come out of the garage rock/post-punk revival. \n\nEnjoy.
