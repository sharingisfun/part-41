Unlike parody king Weird Al Yankovic, Stevens made most of his impact with original material, often based on cultural trends of the day. Yet his knack for sheer silliness translated across generations, not to mention countless compilations and special TV offers. Stevens was a legitimately skilled singer and producer who also performed straight country and pop, scoring the occasional serious hit. But in general, comic novelty songs were his bread and butter, and his brand of humor somehow managed to endure seismic shifts in popular taste and style.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tCountry\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Jeremiah Peabody's Poly Unsaturated Quick Dissolving Fast Acting Pleasant Tasting Green And Purple Pills\n02.Ahab The Arab\n03.Harry The Hairy Ape\n04.Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)\n05.Mr. Businessman\n06.Gitarzan\n07.Everything Is Beautiful\n08.Turn Your Radio On\n09.The Streak\n10.Misty\n11.Shriner's Convention\n12.Would Jesus Wear A Rolex\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc14838246348762fb67df2a3afbd8fea72cb6d4","amp;dn":"Ray+Stevens+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282004%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc14838246348762fb67df2a3afbd8fea72cb6d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,20,131,130,70,52,135,98,251,103,223,42,58,251,216,254,167,44,182,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
