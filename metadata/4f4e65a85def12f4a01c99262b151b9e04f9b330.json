As with others in this series, there are over 100 tracks. This set is roughly based on a very early (1940s) Decca 78rpm album of rare 1920s material from the old Vocalion and Brunswick catalogs (Buell Kazee, Hill Billies, Dad Crockett, Bascom Lunsford, etc) that proved to be quite influential among folksingers and the early old-time revivalists like New Lost City Ramblers. \n\nThere is plenty here of interest to old time fans, though some of the groups that appear here seem selected totally at random (George Roark, Charlie Parker, Walter Couch and Red Patterson are each represented with one cutÃ¢â‚¬â€all good tracks, but we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t figure out what the connection to the other material is. The groups that get the most attention are Buell Kazee (40 songs) and The Carolina Tar Heels (22 Victor tracks). There are also 7 pieces each by Bascom Lamar Lunsford and NelstoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hawaiians. Collectors should note right away that the 40 Kazee songs almost totally duplicate two fairly recent Buell Kazee reissues on the British Archive label. The Nelstone cuts are nice, and seldom heard, and there are a few well chosen tracks by Dr. Humphrey Bate and Al HopkinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Buckle Busters.\n\nAll in all, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a lot here for the old time fan to enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f4e65a85def12f4a01c99262b151b9e04f9b330","amp;dn":"Mountain+Frolic+-+Rare+Old+Timey+Classics+1924-37+%284CD+-JSP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f4e65a85def12f4a01c99262b151b9e04f9b330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,78,101,168,93,239,18,244,160,28,153,38,43,21,27,158,4,249,179,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
