The luck of the Irish was with the ABB for this show.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band welcomed Steely Dan lead singer Donald Fagen for the first time at this show, and Fagen added soulful vocals to Bob Dylan's &quot;Down Along The Cove&quot; and the Grateful Dead classic &quot;Shakedown Street.&quot;  Add in the first &quot;Who To Believe&quot; of this Beacon run, plus a ripping &quot;Kind Of Bird,&quot; and the first set alone was a full night of music!\n\nThe ABB kicked off the second set with a dreamy &quot;Ain't Wastin' Time No More&quot; before getting bluesy with &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; and going jazzy on &quot;Desdemona.&quot;  The parade of special guests continued when Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford, and Latin percussionist Bobby Allende joined in on &quot;Born Under A Bad Sign&quot; and &quot;The Same Thing.&quot;  Anybody who saw Whitford at Warren's Christmas Jam knows he can jam, and he really rips it up on these classic blues tunes!\n\nAn extended version of &quot;No One To Run With&quot; came next, with the &quot;JaMaBuBu&quot; drum segment in the middle, an unusual place for it.  For the encore, Whitford, bassists Lincoln Schleifer, and original Meters guitarist Leo Nocentelli helped turn &quot;Southbound&quot; into a guitar orgy of epic proportions!  The guests really added a lot to this show.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDisc One\n\n1. You Don't Love Me (7:56)\n2. Midnight Rider (3:30)\n3.
