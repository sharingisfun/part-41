Although Clarke used to bring his higher concepts to bear in the space of a single song, this one's more of a full exploration of the character in the title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ served up at the best moments with more soul than on previous albums from Stanley, some nicely tuneful tracks that almost get a bit funky at points. There's a bit of vocals on the record ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ courtesy of Dee Dee Bridgewater and others ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and guests\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Opening Statement 4:22\n02.
