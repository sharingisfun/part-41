A lot of time and energy went into this remaster, I'm very proud of it. I hope all the Devo fans will love this. \n\nNotes\n\n*This is not the 2014 reissue, it's copied from the 1990.\n*It's not a geniue FLAC format, I remastered from MP3 files (still sounds good)\n*I put all the best tracks together and the worst tracks together (personally opinion)\n*I worked hard on &quot;Stop look and listen&quot; but I had a difficult time getting the Lead vocal properly balanced. \n\nPlease leave feedback and comments. And enjoy spuds - Kasper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e364b2db379801b9a01509d6535b5e0029d46920","amp;dn":"Devo+-+Hardcore+%28Fan+Remaster%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e364b2db379801b9a01509d6535b5e0029d46920","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,100,178,219,55,152,1,185,160,21,9,214,83,91,94,0,41,212,105,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
