Alongside Long is Jorge Garcia (Lost) as Steve Wozniak, James Urbaniak playing Bill Gates and Michaela Watkins filling the role of Melinda Gates. Ryan Perez directs.\n\nWhile a parody, &quot;iSteve&quot; is the first film to take on the Apple cofounder's life story since his death in October 2011. An independent biopic featuring Ashton Kutcher, titled &quot;Jobs,&quot; was screened at this year's Sundance Festival in January, but has yet to see a theatrical release.
