Ciara)\nAlbum: Taking Back My Love-Single\nYear: 2009\nMV Year: 2009\n\n\n\n&quot;&quot;The video was shot in Los Angeles on January 13, 2009 and directed by the Norwegian director Ray Kay, who helmed Christina MilianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Us Against the World&quot; clip, amongst many other videos for R&amp;B music artists. The video was released in February 2009.\n\nThe entire music video is shot under blue-screen to give off a radiant but monotone color set. The music video opens up viewing portraits of Enrique and Ciara, then an ironic switch showing the two arguing and pushing back and forth outside of the house. The two part ways, and the song begins with Enrique's first verse. He sings as the video randomly shoots back to a scene where Ciara is up against a wall. The chorus enters as Enrique is shown throwing things off a counter and out of drawers.\n\nThe next verse enters Ciara walking in the room apparently angry at Enrique. As she sings her verse, she proceeds to pick up a jacket that reads &quot;From C, with Love&quot; and heads to the pool and throws the jacket in the water. What ensues shortly after is a back and forth argument involving the two destroying the house, from Enrique throwing dishes and glasses out of the refrigerator, to Ciara burning songbooks and pouring paint on top of his car. Then, two briefly meet in the dining room of the house, where they obviously still have feelings for one another. They then kiss and perform sexual dance-like moves against each other. Then, as Ciara comes back to reality and snatches his hand off of her, the two immediately go right back to arguing and destroying what's left of the house. As the video closes, the two are seen in a destroyed dining room with lights flickering on and off, approaching each other once again. Enrique then grabs Ciara, and the video ends with the two kissing and smiling.&quot;\n\n\n\nChart Performance (US*):\n=====================\nU.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play\t/8\n=====================\n\n\n\n\n*There are simply too many charts available, so only the US is shown.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b20ef6b11246c6026e7fa85086dbe16c5323d16b","amp;dn":"Enrique+Iglesias+Featuring+Ciara-Takin%5C%27+Back+My+Love+%5BOFFICIA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b20ef6b11246c6026e7fa85086dbe16c5323d16b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,14,246,177,18,70,198,2,110,127,168,80,134,219,225,108,83,35,209,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
