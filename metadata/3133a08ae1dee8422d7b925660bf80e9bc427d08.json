I love this release. Dystopia are one mother fucking great brutal band that connects me with a lot of stuff that I like (smoking weed, wanting to be left alone by the humanity, dying from alcoholism, etc.). Take notice, the last song (&quot;Sleep&quot;) has an almost 20 minutes long silence gap and I've left it like it is (didn't cut it up). You should just let it play, maybe you'll fall asleep (like I did when I first listened to this release) and get scared when the song kicks back in.
