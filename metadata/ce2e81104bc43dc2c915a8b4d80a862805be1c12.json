By using simple, powerful commands you can focus on the differences you&amp;#039;re interested in and ignore those you&amp;#039;re not.  You can then merge the changes, synchronize your files, and generate reports for your records.\n\nYou can compare entire drives and folders at high speed, checking just sizes and modified times.  Or, thoroughly verify every file with byte-by-byte comparisons.  FTP sites and zip files are integrated seamlessly, so you can update your website with the touch of a button.\n\nOnce you&amp;#039;ve found specific files you&amp;#039;re interested in, Beyond Compare can intelligently pick the best way to compare and display them.  Text files can be viewed and edited with syntax highlighting and comparison rules tweaked specifically for documents, source code, and HTML.  Data files, executables, binary data, and images all have dedicated viewers as well, so you always have a clear view of the changes.\n\nHere are some of the significant new features in Beyond Compare 3.
