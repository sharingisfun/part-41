The magazine ran for 38 issues between 1981 and 1999, primarily as a direct marketing approach similar to Nintendo Power that raised awareness of upcoming games and was distributed to fans and customers of the company.\n\nSierra On-Line was one of the earliest success stories in the PC gaming world, founded in 1979 by Ken and Roberta Williams, and was well-known for its succession of popular PC games in the 1980s and 1990s with best-selling franchises that included King's Quest, Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Gabriel Knight, Police Quest and many more.\n\nThe magazine's first issue was published in June 1981 as a grayscale newsletter, distributed just one year after the company was formed and dubbed &quot;On-Line Letter.&quot; After On-Line Systems was renamed Sierra On-Line in 1982, the magazine changed to &quot;Sierra Newsletter&quot; for issue #2-5. Issues #6-10 were called &quot;Sierra News Magazine&quot; to celebrate the redesigned glossy magazine layout, and issue #11 was dubbed &quot;Sierra/Dynamix News Magazine&quot; to recognize the company's first major acquisition in 1990.\n\nBeginning with issue #12 in the fall of 1991, &quot;InterAction Magazine&quot; published as a quarterly for 8 years until its final issue, #38 in 1999. In 1995, the software company was sold to CUC, a consumer services conglomerate, for $1.5 billion, a sale that made Ken and Roberta Williams instant billionaires. Unfortunately, the company and legacy they left behind did not prosper without their leadership and layoffs and internal reorganization in 1999 led to the demise of Sierra On-Line and InterAction.\n\nComplete Issue Listing for Sierra Interaction:\n#01 - Cranston Manor (June 1981)\n#02 - 3-D Helicopter Simulator (1987)\n#03 - King's Quest III Ships for Apple (Spring 1988)\n#04 - King's Quest IV Arrives (Winter 1988)\n#05 - New Sierra Hit System (Spring 1989)\n#06 - Roberta Williams (Autumn 1989)\n#07 - Christy Marx Conquers Camelot (Spring 1990)\n#08 - Tenth Anniversary Issue, 1980-1990 (Summer 1990)\n#09 - Holidays 1990 (Fall 1990)\n#10 - Foolin' Around with Two Guys From Andromeda (Spring 1991)\n#11 - Larry's New Look (Summer 1991)\n#12 - Games to Get Young Minds Moving (Fall 1991)\n#13 - The Dagger of Amon Ra (Spring 1992)\n#14 - Sneak Peek: Fall '92 (Summer 1992)\n#15 - King's Quest VI (Fall 1992)\n#16 - Computer Football (Winter 1992)\n#17 - Space Quest V (June 1993)\n#18 - Betrayal at Krondor (Summer 1993)\n#19 - Holidays 1993 (Holiday 1993)\n#20 - Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers (Spring 1994)\n#21 - Outpost Strategy Guide (Fall 1994)\n#22 - King's Quest VII (Holiday 1994)\n#23 - The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain (Spring 1995)\n#24 - Space Quest VI: The Spinal Frontier (Fall 1995)\n#25 - Torin's Passage (Holiday 1995)\n#26 - Earthsiege 2 (Spring 1996)\n#27 - Lighthouse (Summer 1996)\n#28 - Bobby Labonte, NASCAR RACING (Fall 1996)\n#29 - Rama (Holiday 1996)\n#30 - Shivers: Harvest of Souls (Spring 1997)\n#31 - Betrayal in Antara (Summer 1997)\n#32 - Red Baron II (Fall 1997)\n#33 - Lords of Magic (Holiday 1997)\n#34 - Sierra Sports (Spring 1998)\n#35 - Half-Life (Summer 1998)\n#36 - Starsiege (Fall 1998)\n#37 - King's Quest: Mask of Eternity (Holiday 1998)\n#38 - Homeworld (Spring 1999)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49690fe023edee1f9cc6b1675d077cd5704ab56a","amp;dn":"Sierra+InterAction+Magazine+%5B1981-1999%5D%5BComplete%5D%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49690fe023edee1f9cc6b1675d077cd5704ab56a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,105,15,224,35,237,238,31,156,198,177,103,93,7,124,213,112,74,181,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
