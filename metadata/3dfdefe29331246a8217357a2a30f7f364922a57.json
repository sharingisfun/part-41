He studied at the universities of London, Goettingen and California and received his D.Sc. degree from University of Southampton, England. He was an economics professor at California State University Los Angeles and a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution from 1968 to 1973. During his time at the Hoover Institute he wrote the major study Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development (in three volumes), detailing how the West played a major role in developing Soviet Union from its very beginnings up until the present time (1970). He was forced out of the Hoover Institute after publishing National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union in 1973.\n\nBibliography\n\n1 - Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development: 1917-1930 (1968)\n2 - Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development: 1930-1945 (1971)\n3 - Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development: 1945-1965 (1973)\n4 -National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union (1973)\n5 - What Is Libertarianism?
