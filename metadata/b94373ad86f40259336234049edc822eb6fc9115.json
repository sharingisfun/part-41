With this crowd, anything can happen! \n\nPlot Outline: An aspiring teenage cartoonist and his friends come to the aid of a singer trying to save her family property from developers\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith a name like Hoops McCann, he's bound to get that basketball scholarship after high school, right? Wrong! What Hoops really wants to do is write and illustrate a love story. To help him find his way, his friend George invites Hoops to come with him and his sister to spend the summer on Nantucket. The friends Crazy Summer begins when they pickup Cassandra on the way--she's being chased by a motorcycle gang. From here on in, it only gets crazier. Once on the island, Hoops and George, along with George's island friends the Stork twins and Ack-Ack (son of a marine), must help Cassandra save her grandfather's house from the greedy Beckersted Family. Along the way, Hoops must find a way to write his cartoon love story - and maybe a real one of his own.\n\nCast: \n\nJohn Cusack ....  Hoops McCann \n\nDemi Moore ....
