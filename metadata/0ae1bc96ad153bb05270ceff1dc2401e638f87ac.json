So, in addition to all the heavy breathing horror stuff on the soundtrac,  I composed a Spanish guitar tune riffing off of &quot;De Guello&quot; the Dimitri Tiomkin composition used in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; and &quot;The Alamo&quot; I played the theme on a Korg Trinity music workstation. Jeff Baxter added the pedal steel guitar.\nWe needed southwestern bar band blues, so the Texas Toad Lickers were formed. I got to play with legendary musicians. I also got shid-faced drunk with them one night. It wasn't pretty.\nThis was my second collaboration with\t the Bruce Robb held my hand and led me through it. He also played one mean B-3 organ. Of all my music collaborations, ours has been the best\nI really dig this soundtrack. I hope you do too.&quot;\nJohn Carpenter\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae1bc96ad153bb05270ceff1dc2401e638f87ac","amp;dn":"JOHN+CARPENTER-+Vampires+-+SOUNDTRACK+%5BFLAC%5D+1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae1bc96ad153bb05270ceff1dc2401e638f87ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,225,188,150,173,21,59,176,82,112,206,255,29,194,64,30,99,143,135,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
