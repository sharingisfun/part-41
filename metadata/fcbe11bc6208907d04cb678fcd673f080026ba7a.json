The most remarkable feature of this signal limiter is its sonic transparency.  Elephant brings sound limiting and loudness maximization without audible Ã¢â‚¬Å“pumpingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sonic artifacts.\n\nElephant is a highly competitive plug-in for mastering applications: it features a variety of limiter modes that can be deeply customized, and a comprehensive set of level metering tools, including headroom estimation and K-system metering.  Elephant's built-in linear-phase oversampling is an important element in achieving high-quality peak limiting and loudness maximization.\n\nElephant limiter can be used for mixing and mastering of both stereo and multi-channel music and sound material, at any standard sample rate.  Limiting process can be visualized both as gain reduction meter and real-time graph.\n\nElephant, also featuring a DC offset filter, and a high-quality bit-depth converter with an optional noise-shaping, allows you to finish your music and audio productions with a spark.\n\n\n\nApplications\n\n   Mastering peak limiter\n   Loudness maximizer\n   Stereo, 5.1 surround mastering limiter\n   Bit-depth converter with noise-shaping\n   DC offset removal filter\n   Drum bus compressor\n   K level meter\n\n\nElephant features:\n\nTransparent signal limiting action\n9 predefined limiter modes\nLimiter mode editor\nOptional release stage\nNoise-shaped bit-depth converter\nDC offset removal filter\nWaveform graph view\nStereo and multi-channel processing\nInternal channel routing\nChannel grouping\nUp to 8x linear-phase oversampling\n64-bit floating point processing\nPreset manager\nUndo/redo history\nA/B comparisons\nContextual hint messages\nAll sample rates support\n22 ms compensated processing latency\n\n\nChangelog\n\nElephant 4.0, which is backwards-compatible, includes the following changes since version 3:\n\nAdded a new &quot;EL-4&quot; limiter mode, with less harmonic coloration.\nAdded a new &quot;Dynamic Release Control&quot; limiter stage.\nAdded a new &quot;Timing&quot; limiter mode parameter.\nAdded a new &quot;Release to Attack Ratio&quot; limiter mode parameter.\nAdded a new &quot;Release Shape&quot; limiter mode parameter.\nAdded input level meter together with the threshold mark.\nImplemented the &quot;Eval&quot; limiter's evaluation mode.\nAdded the &quot;Trans View&quot; transient visualization.\nMade the &quot;In Gain&quot; and &quot;Out Gain&quot; knob ranges more practical.\nMagnified the &quot;Out Gain&quot; knob's scale around 0 dB.\nMade changes to the &quot;Trans Time&quot; parameter stutter-free.\nThe output statistics are now automatically reset if any parameter that influences the output statistics was changed.\nAdded &quot;EL-4&quot;, &quot;COMPACT&quot; and &quot;EXPANDED&quot; factory limiter modes.\n\n\n\nCompatibility\n\nThis audio plugin can be loaded into any audio host application that conforms to the AudioUnit or VST plugin specification.\n\nThis plug-in is compatible with\n\nThis plug-in is compatible with Windows (32- and 64-bit Windows XP, Vista, 7 and later versions) and Mac OS X (10.5 and later versions, 32- and 64-bit, Intel processor-based) computers (2 GHz dual-core or faster processor with at least 1 GB of system RAM required).\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n       UnZip\n\n       Remove previous serial from your computer.\n\n[WIN]\n1.Run our keygen.\n2.Select &quot;Fusion Field v3.31&quot;.\n3.Click &quot;REMOVE&quot;.\n\n[OSX]\n1.Go to user Preferences dir.\n2.Delete &quot;com.quikquak.Fusion_Field&quot;.\n\n2.Use the keygen on Windows, or serial given in R2R .txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
