The Encyclopedia pulls together over 500 articles that help define and explore contemporary biochemistry, with content experts carefully chosen by the Editorial Board to assure both breadth and depth in its coverage.\n\nEditors-In-Chief William J. Lennarz and M. Daniel Lane have crafted a work that proceeds from the acknowledgement that understanding every living process-from physiology, to immunology, and genetics-is impossible without a grasp on the basic chemistry that provides its underpinning. Each article in the work provides an up-to-date snapshot of a given topic, written by experts, as well as suggestions for further readings for students and researcher wishing to go into greater depth. \n\nAvailable on-line via SciVerse ScienceDirect, the functionality of the Encyclopedia will provide easy linking to referenced articles, electronic searching, as well an online index and glossary to aid comprehension and searchability.\n\nThis 4-volume set, thoroughly up-to-date and comprehensive, expertly captures this fast-moving field\nCurated by two esteemed editors-in-chief and an illustrious team of editors and contributors, representing the state of the field\nSuggestions for further readings offer researchers and students avenues for deeper exploration; a wide-ranging glossary aids comprehension","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb103d8e355dff51b39da7ee5c79cdbb77609912","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Biological+Chemistry+-+1st+%26amp%3B+2nd+Ed+-Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb103d8e355dff51b39da7ee5c79cdbb77609912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,16,61,142,53,93,255,81,179,157,167,238,92,121,205,187,119,96,153,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
