Gorham was an American author, publisher, and philosopher who operated out of the mainstream. In a series of self-published books he articulated an idiosyncratic world view, the essence of which was that advanced civilization alienates individuals from their actual selves (and their natural connection with nature as a whole) primarily by means of verbal programming, in which entities which Gorham regarded as mere abstractions (like the state, the nation, or society) were taken to be substantial existents. He upheld what he regarded as the superior civilization of pre-Christian Northern Europeans, whom he believed lived in small voluntary tribes without elaborate superstructures of government or law, and he recommended a return to that mode of existence.
