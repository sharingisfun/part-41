Rivers' cousin John Otto soon joined on drums, and guitarist Wes Borland completed the original foursome (later supplemented by DJ Lethal). After Korn played the Jacksonville area in 1995, bassist Fieldy got several tattoos from Durst (a tattoo artist) and the two became friends. The next time Korn were in the area, they picked up Limp Bizkit's demo tape and were so impressed that they passed it on to their producer, Ross Robinson. Thanks mostly to word-of-mouth publicity, the band was chosen to tour with House of Pain and the Deftones. The label contracts came pouring in, and after signing with Flip/Interscope, Limp Bizkit released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill Y'All. By mid-1998, Limp Bizkit had become one of the more hyped bands in the burgeoning rap-metal scene, helped as well by more touring action -- this time with Faith No More and later, Primus -- as well as an appearance on MTV's Spring Break '98 fashion show. The biggest break, however, was a spot on that summer's Family Values Tour, which greatly raised the group's profile. \n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tFlip/Interscope\nCatalog:\t\tDS6945/277 469-8\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Introbra\n02.Bring It Back\n03.Gold Cobra\n04.Shark Attack\n05.Get A Life\n06.Shotgun\n07.Douche Bag\n08.Walking Away\n09.Loser\n10.Autotunage\n11.90.2.10\n12.Why Try\n13.Killer In You\n14.Back Porch\n15.My Own Cobain\n16.Angels\n17.Middle Finger (Feat.
