Theology is important because what we believe affects how we live. If youâ€™re a relatively new believer in Jesus, or if youâ€™re a more mature Christian looking for a quick brush-up on basics of the faith, Christian Beliefs is for you. This readable guide to twenty basic Christian beliefs is a condensation of Wayne Grudemâ€™s award-winning book on systematic theology, prized by pastors and teachers everywhere. He and his son, Elliot, have boiled down the essentials of Christian theology for the average layperson and made them both clear and applicable to life. You will learn about the Bible, the characteristics of God, what it means that we are created in the image of God, what God has done for us in Christ, the purpose of the church, and much more. Each chapter includes questions for personal review or group discussion. These truly are twenty basic beliefs that every Christian should know","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6268cebf3ba90f335118f81a18700a21dc0c6fec","amp;dn":"Christian+Beliefs%3ATwenty+Basics+Every+Christian+should+know+-+W.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6268cebf3ba90f335118f81a18700a21dc0c6fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,104,206,191,59,169,15,51,81,24,248,26,24,112,10,33,220,12,111,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
