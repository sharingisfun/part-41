The Emmy and Peabody Award-winning Daily Show takes a reality-based look at news, trends, pop culture, current events, politics, sports and entertainment with an alternative point of view. In each show anchorman Jon Stewart and a team of correspondents, including Robert Corddry, Ed Helms and Samantha Bee and Lewis Black, comment on the day's stories, employing actual news footage, taped field pieces, in-studio guests and on-the-spot coverage of important news events.\n\nVideo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 21mn 30s\nBit rate                         : 1 884 Kbps\nWidth                            : 960 pixels\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSource                           : The Daily Show with Jon Stewart 1080i HDTV DD2.0 MPEG2-CtrlHD.ts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c260a3d7f5804baca3fd93766a876fe50f7c3b0f","amp;dn":"The.Daily.Show.2010.02.25.Rep.James.Clyburn.HR.HDTV.XviD-NATiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c260a3d7f5804baca3fd93766a876fe50f7c3b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,96,163,215,245,128,75,172,163,253,147,118,106,135,111,229,15,124,59,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
