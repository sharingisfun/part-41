But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all! We also talk about GamesCom and the big announcements Microsoft and Sony made and discuss the wackiness that is Saints Row IV.\n\nListen to our podcast by clicking on the link below and be sure to check back here every Thursday at 12 pm Pacific time for the next episode of The Gaming Precision Podcast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afac70b232ee8183b18c677ef597f964853a8c56","amp;dn":"The+Gaming+Precision+Podcast+%231%3A+The+Pilot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afac70b232ee8183b18c677ef597f964853a8c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,172,112,178,50,238,129,131,177,140,103,126,245,151,249,100,133,58,140,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
