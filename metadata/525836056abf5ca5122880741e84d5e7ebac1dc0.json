Using a formula combining classic rock and rhythm &amp; blues they simply canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go wrong. \n\nFrom the beginning the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s philosophy has been a raw, swinging and rattling rhythm group with a strong vocal in front, all appearing vigorous and real. \n\nRoskilde Festival Wrote:\n\nHighway Child is for everyone addicted to classic rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all the good old stuff from MC5 to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. The lads are already an experienced and hardened live band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and despite sold-out shows, an album recorded and ready, and rave mentions in the underground, they still have no record deal. This band should end up in the same league as the best garage rock bands of our time.\n\nMembers:\n\nPatrick HeinsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸e - Vocals\nPaw Eriksen - Guitar\nAndreas Henriksen - Drums\nChristian Norup - Bass\n\nHometown:\t\tCopenhagen\nRecord Label: \t\tBackdoor Records\nCurrent Location: \tCopenhagen\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Red, White And Blue\n02.In The End\n03.When The Sun Burned The Ground\n04.Sanctuary Come\n05.Once Is Once Too Much\n06.Turn Me On\n07.Dear Girl\n08.You You You\n09.Take You Down\n10.Born On The Run\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:525836056abf5ca5122880741e84d5e7ebac1dc0","amp;dn":"Highway+Child+-+Sanctuary+Come+%282009%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"525836056abf5ca5122880741e84d5e7ebac1dc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,88,54,5,106,191,92,165,18,40,128,116,30,132,213,231,235,172,29,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
