OK many of his songs aren't 'deep' [well other the odd Deep Purple cover], but whats wrong with taking a paddle in the shallows occasionally. Plus some are great Australian folk [e.g. Waltzing Matilda, Tie my Kangaroo down, Six white boomers] - and the kids like his slightly riske lines, e.g. about Mary also having a little bear: 'and everywhere that Mary went, you saw her bear behind...' \n\ncd's ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89c82c6798db49029af825a9a1f07461c3dfafc8","amp;dn":"Rolf+Harris...Platinum+Collection%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89c82c6798db49029af825a9a1f07461c3dfafc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,200,44,103,152,219,73,2,154,248,37,169,161,240,116,97,195,223,175,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
