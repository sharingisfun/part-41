They engage in Sharpton and Obama talk, reminisce about &quot;Tough Crowd,&quot; discuss how salaries have changed over the years, we find out where to get Nick's podcast (RiotCast, iTunes, Stitcher), and they bond over their shared love of The Sopranos. Ant and Nick swap Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neal stories, talk about comics and their demons, and Ant rants about his merchandise company and the frustration of not being able to talk about race without backlash. Ant tells Nick the story of his breakup with Jill Nicolini, they go over the MTV's Video Music Awards and Miley Cyrus's &quot;movie version of a homeless guy,&quot; and then end with a chat about old-timey masturbation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbab69d58c972e02d636d469bd9ca1b5bdc9e357","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-26+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbab69d58c972e02d636d469bd9ca1b5bdc9e357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,171,105,213,140,151,46,2,214,54,212,105,189,156,161,181,189,201,227,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
