There is no need to tell you how awful this record, McCartney's latest, sounds.\n\nThis minimal remastering, done by me (I'm a professionnal sound engineer), is a tentative of restoring all the &quot;sonic details&quot; lost during the audio destruction (read : compression) process.\n\nEven though I can't do no miracles (double negation !), this is the best I could achieve out of those permanently destroyed tapes. I also reduced the volume output in order not to compress even the most minimal peak created during the dynamic range restoration. Back in the 60's, records were that loud. Why would they be louder today ?\n\nHope you'll enjoy it as much as I... and by the way, this torrent is also available in FLAC !\n\nChris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c8e4df66284e65a453c765acc19bd01b442a0f3","amp;dn":"MP3+-+Paul+McCartney+-+Memory+Almost+Full+%28remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c8e4df66284e65a453c765acc19bd01b442a0f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,142,77,246,98,132,230,90,69,60,118,90,204,25,189,1,180,66,160,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
