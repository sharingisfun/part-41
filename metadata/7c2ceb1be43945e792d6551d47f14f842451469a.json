While calorie-free cake remains a food fantasy, there really are foods that cost us almost nothing to eat, calorie-wise \r\n\r\nNegative calorie foods take more energy to chew and digest than they actually contain, so you'll never have to worry about eating these foods in large quantities or gaining weight from them. They also contain ample amounts of vitamins, fiber and antioxidants. Next time you're in the mood for a snack, reach for one of these foods instead of that bag of chips, which we all know does more harm than good. \r\n\r\nThis book was written for anyone who is determined to lose weight effectively and in a healthy way. While it does require more than the average amount of discipline to choose healthy foods (as with other types of healthy weight loss diets), you can expect to see outstanding results within weeks, even sooner if you combine it with regular exercise. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere Is A Preview Of What You'll Learn...\r\n\r\nSpinach, Celery, Tomato and Mint Egg Scramble \r\nGingery Carrot and Apple Cinnamon Hash \r\nZucchini, Tomato, Mushroom and Basil Scramble \r\nWatercress and Shiitake Mushroom Soup \r\nCream of Broccoli and Cauliflower Veggie Soup \r\nGreens and Reds Salad with Cilantro Dressing \r\nAsparagus and Roasted Beets with Fruity Vinaigrette \r\nPortobello and Brown Rice Burgers \r\nKorean-style Mushroom and Veggie Lettuce Wraps \r\nParsnip and Beet Energy Bars \r\nSpicy Chicken Stuffed Jalapenos \r\nMuch, much more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2ceb1be43945e792d6551d47f14f842451469a","amp;dn":"Negative+Calorie+Diet+Cookbook-50+Top+Rated+Negative+Calorie+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2ceb1be43945e792d6551d47f14f842451469a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,44,235,27,228,57,69,231,146,214,85,29,71,241,79,132,36,81,70,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
