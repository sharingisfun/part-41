The Observer\nÃƒÂ¢??Marvellous Aerial PhotographyÃƒÂ¢?? The Times\nÃƒÂ¢??Breathtakingly BeautifulÃƒÂ¢?? The Sunday Times\n\nFirstly, I think it only fair to point out that this torrent is a rip from the 1985 VHS television programme.  This of course means that, although taken from an original tape, the quality can be a bit ropey in places.  That said, the film still manages to convey the mind-blowing views of the Andes as would be seen from a Condor gliding over those ranges.\n\nHere is the blurb from the back of the cassette:\nSouth America is a continent of violent extremes, dominated by the worldÃƒÂ¢??s longest and most spectacular mountain chain, The Andes.  It is a land of ice and fire, where a glacier thundering into the ocean, is surrounded by dense forest alive with humming- birds.\n\nUsing the resources and experience of the universally famous BBC Natural History Unit and five expert wildlife cameramen, Michael Andrews produced a unique photographic portrait of a little known yet immensely beautiful world.  This videocassette, incorporating the haunting music of Gumary and Inti Illimani, is an adaptation of that visually breathtaking television series which took nearly two years to make.\n\nFrom a condorÃƒÂ¢??s eye view a landscape of stunning beauty and contrast is revealed and at ground level we can observe the remarkably varied animal population whose lives are shaped by their magnificent surroundings.\n\nRunning Time: 60 minutes\nNarrated by Andrew Sachs\nWritten and produced by Michael Andrews\nOriginal Air Time: 1982 (http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/galleries/animal-covers/06/)\nVideo Release: 1985\n\nVideo Width: 352 x 264 (sorry but this is how I was best able to maintain quality ÃƒÂ¢?? NB I have re-burnt this AVI to DVD and it worked well)\nVideo Type: AVI (DIVX Codec)\nVideo Frame Rate: 25 Frames/Second\nVideo Sample Size: 12 bit\nAudio: 192 Kbps (Lame MP3)\n\nIf anybody out there is a fan of the BBC wildlife documentaries then this is a must to download.  To my mind it compares and even exceeds a lot of that organisations more recent output. Brilliant camerawork, inspired musical accompaniment and a simply divine subject matter.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcad4839788792ab85feed66eeb99cf9a7976850","amp;dn":"Flight+Of+The+Condor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcad4839788792ab85feed66eeb99cf9a7976850","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,173,72,57,120,135,146,171,133,254,237,102,238,185,156,249,167,151,104,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
