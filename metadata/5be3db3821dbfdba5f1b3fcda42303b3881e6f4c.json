I filmed this myself with a Kodak Playsport HD camcorder. Some of the camera work is shaky but if you love the Crue, this is worth watching. I even got the surprise beginning explosions before Wildside. It's pretty much the entire show minus some talking and I believe S.O.S. and Don't go Away Mad missing the beginning. I have no idea how to shrink the filesize, I used Power Director to put the individual clips together. If anyone can advise me on how to do that I would be happy to resubmit it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5be3db3821dbfdba5f1b3fcda42303b3881e6f4c","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+Live+in+Las+Vegas+June+18%2C+2011+Red+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5be3db3821dbfdba5f1b3fcda42303b3881e6f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,227,219,56,33,219,253,186,95,27,63,205,164,35,3,179,136,30,111,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
