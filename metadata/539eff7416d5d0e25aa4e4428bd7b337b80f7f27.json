This is a live show from late 1963, on which Chicago blues great Sonny Boy Williamson is backed by an extremely green Yardbirds. Yes, Eric Clapton is on here; no, he doesn't play well, managing some thin, extremely tentative solos that find him stumbling occasionally. It's really not that bad, though, as Sonny Boy himself sings well. But it should really be treated as a Sonny Boy Williamson release that happens to have a soon-to-be-famous-but-still-embryonic band in the background, in the manner of the sides the Beatles cut in Hamburg supporting Tony Sheridan. All of the material, and even some unreleased/alternate takes from the same dates, has since shown up on anthologies that are much easier to find than this instant collector's item.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.Bye Bye Bird (Dixon, Williamson) \n2.Mr. Downchild (Miller, Williamson) \n3.23 Hours Too Long (Boyd, Williamson) \n4.Out on the Water Coast (Williamson) \n5.Baby Don't Worry (Miller, Williamson) \n6.Pontiac Blues (Williamson) 4:01\n7.Take It Easy Baby [Version One] (Williamson) \n8.I Don't Care No More (Miller, Williamson) \n9.Do the Weston (Miller, Williamson) \n\nBonus Tracks:\n\n10.The River Rhine (Miller, Williamson) \n11.A Lost Care (Miller, Williamson) \n12.Western Arizona (Miller, Williamson) \n13.Take It Easy Baby [Version Two] (Williamson) \n14.Slow Walk (Miller, Williamson)\n15.Highway 69 (Miller, Williamson) \n16.Hey Little Cabin (Miller, Williamson) \n\n* Repertoire Records, REP 4776-WY (1999)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539eff7416d5d0e25aa4e4428bd7b337b80f7f27","amp;dn":"Sonny+Boy+Williamson+%26amp%3B+The+Yardbirds+-+Live+At+The+Craw+%28196","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539eff7416d5d0e25aa4e4428bd7b337b80f7f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,158,255,116,22,213,208,226,90,164,228,66,139,215,179,55,184,15,127,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
