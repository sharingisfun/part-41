Because Zeus will do anything to save the Ancients from their dying planet, and he has a plan.\n\nThousands of humans crossed over to Loge after a poisonous neurotoxin released into Earth's atmosphere, nearly killing them. They sought refuge in hopes of finding a new life, but what they became were slaves, built to wage war against their home planet. That is, unless Ari and Jackson can stop them. But on Loge, nothing is as it seems...and no one can be trusted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b81129cfe8cb6232407b094cbb234cfeaa91bf7","amp;dn":"Hover+by+Melissa+West","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b81129cfe8cb6232407b094cbb234cfeaa91bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,129,18,156,254,140,182,35,36,7,176,148,203,178,52,207,234,169,27,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
