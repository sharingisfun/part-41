At first it looks like another internet hoax, some lightweight \nquestions were followed by lightweight answers, but then things started \nchanging drastically.\n\nAnyone who understands dialectics knows that the answers Insider gave were \ndesigned to force/provoke others to ask questions which went to the core of \nthe matter. First some questions are being asked by Insider like &quot;Are you \nreally living on the planet you think you are?&quot; which made people react \ndifferently than before. The answers this person started giving to those \nfollowing questions showed a deep, broad understanding of philosophy, history, \nmetaphysics, religion, magic, politics, and more in a way which is very \ninnovative, detailed and some answers are thought provoking to say the least.\n\nWhat amazes is that Insider answered these questions in a very short time span \nand if you keep in mind that the topics are diverse, some indepth and some \nepic answers showed up literally minutes apart, one must wonder how it was \ndone. Copy/paste from internet? I checked intensively and the sentences \nInsider used cannot be found on internet. Like one person observed, this was \nway over the heads of the usual suspects.\n\nSome people started getting upset, others were drawn to it and this all lead \nto a dialogue where so much was revealed, including by the other posters that \nit can be studied for years to come.\n\nSounds hard to believe? Read on.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103455c003b14e1089ee6ba5a09e3858268a68c0","amp;dn":"Revelations+of+an+Elite+family+Insider+%282005%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103455c003b14e1089ee6ba5a09e3858268a68c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,52,85,192,3,177,78,16,137,238,107,165,160,158,56,88,38,138,104,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
