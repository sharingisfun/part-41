The Italian band got more fans \nworldwide with every album and could realize some of their dreams. That's why they gradually yet resolutely developed their contemporary unique style, which is \ngenerally labelled as film score metal.\n\nIt was about high time for a DVD and it even turned out to be a double one. We all know: if Rhapsody does something, they do it well. &quot;Visions From The \nEnchanted Lands&quot; indeed is a larger than life fantastic document, something to lick one's chops over and over again. DVD 1 includes a majority of live material. \nFrom the very outset, images and sound are so overwhelming that it seems as if you are at the first row of a true Rhapsody In Fire concert. Many registrations are \ncoming from the &quot;Demons, Dragons And Warriors Tour&quot; in 2005 throughout North America and Canada. Now they offer you the views of the earlier released \ndouble CD &quot;Live In Canada 2005 - The Dark Secret&quot;, but there are some live registrations from Germany and Czech Republic as well. On top of that we have two \npreviously unreleased songs (audio only) on this disc, plus two videos.\n\nDVD 2 is more focused on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; material (while even on DVD 1 we had fragments with fans and the band members too). Videos and stories about \nthe making of are intermittent with a live song again and explanations about the live equipment (what a good-looking guitar Luca Turilli has!!!) are followed by \ninteresting things worth knowing about Christopher Lee, the orchestra, and of course their label-mates Manowar and the management with who they have close \ncontact. That's why we even can have a look into Manowar's studio and a rehearsal. No need to say that you are busy with all this for quite a while, but it is truly \nworthwhile to purchase this amazing double DVD!\n\nTracklist:\nDVD 01:\nUnholy Warcry (introduction)\nThe Past Few Years\nThe Wisdom Of The Kings (Live from Germany)\nThe Fans\nThe Village Of Dwarves (Live from Canada)\nThe Mystical Journey\nErian's Mystical Rhymes (Live from Canada)\nDrum Solo (Live from Canada)\nCanadian Cousins\nDawn Of Victory (Live from Canada)\nLamento Eroico (Live from Canada)\nEmerald Sword (Live from Canada)\nCzech Republic &quot;Masters of Rock&quot;:\nThe Village Of Dwarves\nLand Of Immortals\nGermany's Earthshaker Fest 2005:\nHoly Thunderforce\nBonus Videos:\nUnholy Warcry - music video (extended version)\nThe Magic of the Wizard's Dream (German Version)\nUnreleased bonus tracks (audio only):\nAge Of The Red Moon\nPower Of Thy Sword\n\nDVD 02:\nUnholy Warcry - music video\nThe Magic Of The Wizard's Dream - music video\nThe Making of The Dark Secret - documentary\nThe Making of The Wizard's Dream - documentary\nUnholy Warcry (Live from USA)\nLive Equipment\nAdditional Interviews from 2005 Tour\nTriumph Or Agony - Electronic Press Kit\nRehearsal - Erian's Mystical Rhymes\nThe Village Of Dwarves\nOuttakes\nUnholy Warcry - music video (Behind The Scenes)\n\nLine-up/Musicians\n\nLuca Turilli - guitars\nAlex Staropoli - keys\nAlex Holzwarth - drums\nFabio Lione - vocals\nPatrice Guers - bass\nDominique Leurquin - guitar\n\nGuest musicians:\nChristopher Lee - vocals\nManuel Staropoli - flute","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a06fa4d535ba23f2ad0bd8c17cb2f4c71d9eec45","amp;dn":"Rhapsody+of+Fire-Visions+From+The+Enchanted+Lands+%28VIDEO_TS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a06fa4d535ba23f2ad0bd8c17cb2f4c71d9eec45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,111,164,213,53,186,35,242,173,11,216,193,124,178,244,199,29,158,236,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
