They share a house with their two children, one of whom, Nathalie, is apparently a problem. &quot;She wants to kill everyone,&quot; says one of the women, who seem to be interchangeable. &quot;She wants to be an orphan, or a Portuguese maid.&quot;\n\nNathalie, however, remains docileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this being a minimal movie.\n\nThe camera paces through the house, looking into mirrors, down hallways, through windows. There is a report on the radio about a murder and a police manhunt. The telephone rings. Wrong number. &quot;There is no telephone here, madame,&quot; Miss Moreau says into the receiver.&quot; Funny? Not really. It's too pretty and solemn. A salesman calls. He tries desperately to sell a Vedetta Tambour OO8 washing machine that comes in three colors. For a brief moment, the ghost of Pinter's wit walks over the grave of the film. Miss Bose goes into the garden, again. Miss Moreau falls asleep. A cat saunters through. The camera just stares. When a person or a cat leaves a room, Miss Duras seems to say, that room is empty. Such are the discoveries of &quot;Nathalie Granger,&quot; a dead-end movie that, I confidently hope, few of us are ready for.\n\nThe Cast\nNATHALIE GRANGER, directed by Marguerite Duras; screen play (French with English subtitles) by Miss Duras; director of photography, Ghislain Cloquet; editor, Nicole Lubtchansky; produced by Luc Moullet. Running time: 88 minutes. Shown last night at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall.\nIsabelle . . . . . Lucia Bose\nThe Other Woman . . . . . Jeanne Moreau\nSalesman . . . . .
