But that is about to change cause now Spain has a real 80's stadium rock band worth mentioning.\nWell, actually more than just worth mentioning cause the 4 young dudes that make up Hard Spirit play with a maturity that's normally only reserved for those with a lot of on the road experience and everything that comes with that particulat territory. And you probably won't believe it but these guys are the missing link between the heavier Bon Jovi, Hardline &amp; Skid Row in their prime. You have a hard time believing this? Just listen to the samples on their website. Just get yourself an earful of the no less than mighty rocker 'Every Street Of Sorrow' and say that I'm wrong.\nOr take the title track 'Walk The Wild' that starts off as a power ballad but somewhere halfway changes its tempo when the solo kicks in and the headbanging can commence.\nOf course this is a halfway to indie product and the production is not a multi-million dollar one but that didn't keep me from getting that dusty airguitar out of the closet and rocking my brains out!\nDo yourself a favor and check these guys out, anybody with a knack for previously mentioned bands and the 80's feel in general will love this.
