When her old friend, the chief of police (Peter Falk), asks her to impersonate the missing queen in order to reassure the people and halt the revolution, she offers instead three of her customers to play the general, bishop and chief justice, all of whom have died in the revolution.\n\nShortly after its release, the film was negatively reviewed by the New York Times critic, Bosley Crowther, and was favorably reviewed in Variety, &quot;With Jean Genet's apparent approval, Joe Strick and Ben Maddow have eliminated the play's obscene language (though it's still plenty rough) and clarified some of its obscurations. The result is a tough, vivid and dispassionate fantasy.&quot; Following the release of the DVD recording in 2000, Karl Wareham also reviewed it favorably. &quot;'The Balcony' is recommended for those who like an enigma of a film, one that tugs at your subconscious long after the titles fade. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a film that reaches to the very heart of why our society works in the way it does, and presents unrelenting questions and dilemmas.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 84 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 84 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f5bf80d95219683b2f20ee678fac9d92a6c779","amp;dn":"The+Balcony+%281963%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Shelley+Winters%2C+Peter+Falk%2C+Leona","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f5bf80d95219683b2f20ee678fac9d92a6c779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,245,191,128,217,82,25,104,59,47,32,238,103,143,172,157,146,166,199,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
