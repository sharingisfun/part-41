Yet their fight is\n           not over. Winter's surrogate mother, the very elderly dolphin Panama, has passed\n           away, leaving Winter without the only poolmate she has ever known. However, the\n           loss of Panama may have even greater repercussions for Winter, who, according to\n           USDA regulations, cannot be housed alone, as dolphins' social behavior requires\n           them to be paired with other dolphins. Time is running out to find a companion\n           for her before the team at Clearwater loses their beloved Winter to another\n           aquarium.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n                           Greets:\n                Much respects to these groups:\n   MAJESTiC, BabyGirl21, Friends, and other P2P Groups\n\n\n\n\n                            Notes:\n             &quot;You will always enjoy HQ SD x264 rips from\n                most Retail R1 DVD's&quot; - NoRBiT ;)\n\n\n\n                                               NFO Updated: 07-09-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:386f06222f8c468d41d98df772d8ff91acb23f65","amp;dn":"Dolphin.Tale.2.2014.DVDRip.x264-NoRBiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"386f06222f8c468d41d98df772d8ff91acb23f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,111,6,34,47,140,70,141,65,217,141,247,114,216,255,145,172,178,63,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
