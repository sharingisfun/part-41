The band, from the south side of Glasgow, produced a handful of critically acclaimed albums in the early 1980s, and later went on to produce some politically inspired and critically praised work.\n\nSimple Minds have secured a string of successful hit singles, the best known being its number one worldwide hit single &quot;Don&amp;#039;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, from the soundtrack of the John Hughes movie The Breakfast Club.\n\nFounding members Jim Kerr (vocals) and Charlie Burchill (guitar), along with drummer Mel Gaynor, are the core of the band, which currently features Mark Taylor/Andy Gillespie on keyboards and Eddie Duffy on bass guitar.\n\nOnce Upon a Time is the eighth album by Simple Minds, released in 1985. Due to the popularity of the Keith Forsey-penned &quot;Don&amp;#039;t You (Forget About Me)&quot; on The Breakfast Club soundtrack, interest in Simple Minds was at an all-time high by the time this album came out.\n\nSome say it was to spite the song&amp;#039;s success, but the band decided to leave the career-defining cut off the album, and instead let singles like &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot; (UK #7, US #3), &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; (UK #9, US #28), &quot;Sanctify Yourself&quot; (UK #10, US #14), and &quot;Ghost Dancing&quot; (UK #13) speak for themselves. It was a ploy that seemed to pay off as the album topped the UK charts, and peaked on the US charts at number 10.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd95726816f3d8bcc6043b661e0fe433159f7f97","amp;dn":"Simple+Minds+-+Alive+And+Kicking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd95726816f3d8bcc6043b661e0fe433159f7f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,149,114,104,22,243,216,188,198,4,59,102,30,15,228,51,21,159,127,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
