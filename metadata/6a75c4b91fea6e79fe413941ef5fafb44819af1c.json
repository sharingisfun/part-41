It is about a highwayman, or perhaps a footpad, who is betrayed by his wife or lover, and is one of the most widely performed traditional Irish songs. \n\n&quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; is the tale of a highwayman or footpad who, after robbing a military or government official, is betrayed by a woman. The protagonist's wife or lover is sometimes called Molly, Jenny, or Ginny among various other names.\n\nIt has been recorded by numerous professional artists since the 1950s. The song first gained wide exposure when the Irish folk band, The Dubliners, performed it internationally as a signature song, and recorded it on three albums in the 1960s. Building on their success, the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy hit the Irish and British pop charts with the song in the early 1970s. \n\nThe American metal band Metallica brought it to a wider rock audience in 1998 by playing this version very similar to that of Thin Lizzy's with a heavier sound, and won a Grammy for the song in 2000 for Best Hard Rock Performance.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_in_the_Jar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_in_the_Jar&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAbDAaadJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAbDAaadJ&lt;/a&gt; \n  \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video  : MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7700kbps\n   Audio 1: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Audio 2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:46\n\n\n*To change the audio in &quot;Media Player Classic&quot;, just go to &quot;Navigate&quot; then &quot;Audio Language&quot; and choose between the 2 sources* (there's a delay that happens while the audio is switching between the two sources)\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
