He finds a makeshift home with a big-hearted GI, while the mother he does not remember searches desperately for him. Starring a then-unknown Montgomery Clift in his movie debut, directed in a near-documentary style by Fred Zinnemann and filmed in the ragged, rubble-strewn skeleton of Nuremberg, The Search vividly captures the horrifying human cost of war. This milestone of filmmaking won two 1948 Academy AwardsÃ‚Â®: Best Motion Picture Story and a special award to Ivan Jandl for his haunting performance as the lost child.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-No\n\nThere are no subtitles. \n\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
