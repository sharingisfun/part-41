Thanks for the advance earlier but I don't\nknow how many of you noticed the heart-stopping, jaw-dropping skip right on the\nfirst track at 01:02.  Long story short, it was never nuked because supposedly\nit was like that on the cd, although we never saw the cd, but whatever...thanks\nagain.  Retail doesn't include skips or additional hazards, but if you buy it,\nit comes with an extra 10kbps avg bitrate. Enjoy the beautiful crystal clear\npicture. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d851dafaad7293220ce9a13a69b734b220d6c4e","amp;dn":"A_Dozen_Furies-A_Concept_From_Fire-%28Retail%29-2005-KzT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d851dafaad7293220ce9a13a69b734b220d6c4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,133,29,175,170,215,41,50,32,206,154,19,166,155,115,75,34,13,108,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
