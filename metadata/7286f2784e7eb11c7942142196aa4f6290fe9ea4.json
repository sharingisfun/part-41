In &quot;The Majesty of the Law,&quot; a police officer must arrest a very old-fashioned, traditional fellow for assault. The man's principles have the policeman and the whole village, including the man he slugged, sympathizing with him. &quot;One Minute's Wait&quot; is about an little train station and glimpses into the lives of the passengers, with a series of comic setups. The third piece is called &quot;1921&quot; and is about a condemned Irish nationalist and his daring escape. Tyrone Power introduces each story.&quot;\n\nDirected by John Ford\nB&amp;W\n78 min\nEnglish (French hardsub)\nnot my rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7286f2784e7eb11c7942142196aa4f6290fe9ea4","amp;dn":"The+Rising+of+the+Moon+%28Ford%2C+1957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7286f2784e7eb11c7942142196aa4f6290fe9ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,134,242,120,78,126,177,28,121,66,20,33,150,170,79,98,144,254,158,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
