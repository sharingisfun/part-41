In this advanced manual, the alchemical symbols and motifs cease to be a bewildering maze and become helpful signposts on the Path of Liberation. David Goddard clearly explains the interior practices that are the essence of the Great Work itself. By assimilating the knowledge and practicing the exercises contained in this book, you will find that the once-confusing alchemical illustrations are now illuminated mandalas. Using classical Qabalah, and traditions as diverse as the Grail legend, Yoga, and Tibetan Buddhism, Goddard allows students access to the higher Mysteries. His specific teachings and guided practices will enable you to attain the secret to all spiritual works, which can culminate in the completion of the Great Work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bb45753604c86f4ce7669c3d8a42e6932874566","amp;dn":"The+Tower+of+Alchemy+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bb45753604c86f4ce7669c3d8a42e6932874566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,180,87,83,96,76,134,244,206,118,105,195,216,164,46,105,50,135,69,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
