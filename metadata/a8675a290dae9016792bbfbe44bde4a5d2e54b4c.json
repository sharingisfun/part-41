For example, thereâ€™s no longer a singer and many of the musicians from the previous album are no longer present.  \r\nIt makes sense because it seems that guitarist / composer Aaron Marshall is pushing the Intervals sound in another directionâ€¦ and itâ€™s sounding incredible!\r\n \r\nThis has been evinced by the release of two new singles from what will be an all new album! First there was the track â€œIâ€™m Awakeâ€ which was incredible to say the very least. Now, thereâ€™s a new single â€œFableâ€ featuring the talents of Leland Whitty from the experimental Jazz / Hip-Hop collective BADBADNOTGOOD. \r\nItâ€™s every bit as awesome and fully worth the listen. \r\n\r\n I am also excited to announce that the album will feature Cameron McLellan (Protest The Hero) on bass guitar, Travis Orbin (Darkest Hour, Periphery, Sky Eats Airplane) on drums, and all other instrumentation by yours truly. There are also a few guest features, but Iâ€™ll get around to announcing those later. \r\n\r\nMoving forward, I am excited for Intervals to become my outlet for all things guitar and music related, as it was in the very beginning. My goal is to create more frequent and focused content, (lessons, vlogs, etcâ€¦) and of course, return to playing shows, when the time is right.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBUM / TITLE: The Shape of Colour\r\n\r\nYEAR : 2015\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY: Canada\r\n\r\nSTYLE: Progressive Math Metal\r\n\r\nDURATION: 0:34:34\r\n\r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n\r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps \r\n\r\nSize: 84 MB (Files: 9) \r\n\r\n\r\nTracks\r\n\r\n01.
