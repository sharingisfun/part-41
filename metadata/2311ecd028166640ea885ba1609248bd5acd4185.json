He covers the latest on Hillary Clinton, we learn about female Viagra, see a dream poker table, hear about more tomfoolery from LOS, and Anthony talks about Back to the Future and waxes on interviewing Crispin Glover. We then hear about BatgirlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, see a pic of Ã¢â‚¬Å“green bitchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Star Trek, watch a throwback clip of Otto and George and a clip from Vos, get into Ã¢â‚¬Å“boat chatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with KtC, check out a big olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fat naked dude, and take a Ã¢â‚¬Å“bitch breakÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where Ant basically cums talking about lobster bisque and semi-cries about his weight. Ant tells us about a convo he had with Jimmy about drones, we see a quarter-sized drone, discuss the future of drones, the Ashley Madison leak, privacy issues and doxxing, and Anthony explains his relationship with Miss Teen Delaware. TACS takes it to the poker table where Jason Aron and Lee Leshen are back to give us an update on their documentary Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back in Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they chat about time travel movies, movies being relatable, music from movies, Comic Con panels, future technology, Back to the Future super fans, the longevity of the movie, and we get some fun facts/insider info about some of the interviews from the doc.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2311ecd028166640ea885ba1609248bd5acd4185","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-08-19+Back+in+Time+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2311ecd028166640ea885ba1609248bd5acd4185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,17,236,208,40,22,102,64,234,136,91,161,96,146,72,189,90,205,65,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
