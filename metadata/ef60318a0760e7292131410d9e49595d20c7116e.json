It contains 52 tracks, with the average track length well under a minute.\n\nThe album was the first with the new line-up of Seth Putnam, Josh Martin and Nate Linehan and was recorded in 1996 at Headroom Studios, just before the band's 1996 tour with Mortician and Incantation.\n\nThe album was originally titled You're Gay and the album cover was going to contain a mirror, but this idea was later changed. Instead, the record features a lot of songs with the word 'gay' in the title, as well as various insults. Nevertheless, only one song on the album provoked an official complaint and that was the song &quot;You Went To See Dishwalla and Everclear (You're Gay)&quot;, about which the label American Records complained. [1].\n\nThe band's vocalist, Seth Putnam has also stated in interview that this is his favorite Anal Cunt full-length album [2], and this opinion is reflected by many of the band's fans, as shown by the fact that the album debuted at #12 in the CMJ Radio Trade Magazine Loud Chart, before peaking at #10.\n\nThere is a guest appearance from Kyle Severn, from the band Incantation, who plays drums on the track &quot;Kyle From Incantation Has A Mustache.&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n1.&quot;Jack Kevorkian is Cool&quot; - 0:41\n2.&quot;ValuJet&quot; - 1:28\n3.&quot;You've Got No Friends&quot; - 1:13\n4.&quot;You Keep a Diary&quot; - 1:13\n5.&quot;You Own a Store&quot; - 0:38\n6.&quot;You Got Date Raped&quot; - 0:49\n7.&quot;Recycling is Gay&quot; - 0:37\n8.&quot;You're a Cop&quot; - 1:51\n9.&quot;You Can't Shut Up&quot; - 0:19\n10.&quot;You've Got Cancer&quot; - 0:31\n11.&quot;We Just Disagree&quot; - 0:33\n12.&quot;Hungry Hungry Hippos&quot; - 0:18\n13.&quot;You Are an Interior Decorator&quot; - 0:52\n14.&quot;Pottery's Gay&quot; - 0:40\n15.&quot;Rich Goyette is Gay&quot; - 0:53\n16.&quot;Branscombe Richmond&quot; - 1:35\n17.&quot;You Live in Allston&quot; - 0:54\n18.&quot;You Are a Food Critic&quot; - 0:54\n19.&quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; (Grover Washington, Jr. cover) - 0:27\n20.&quot;Your Band's In the Cut-Out Bin&quot; - 1:11\n21.&quot;You're Gay&quot; - 0:38\n22.&quot;You Look Adopted&quot; - 1:17\n23.&quot;Your Cousin is George Lynch&quot; - 0:11\n24.&quot;You Have Goals&quot; - 0:23\n25.&quot;You Drive an IROC&quot; - 0:56\n26.&quot;You Play On a Softball Team&quot; - 0:58\n27.&quot;Because You're Old&quot; - 0:45\n28.&quot;You Sell Cologne&quot; - 0:30\n29.&quot;Being a Cobbler Is Dumb&quot; - 0:28\n30.&quot;You Live in a Houseboat&quot; - 0:45\n31.&quot;Richard Butler&quot; - 1:32\n32.&quot;311 Sucks&quot; - 0:40\n33.&quot;Your Kid is Deformed&quot; - 0:41\n34.&quot;You Are an Orphan&quot; - 1:06\n35.&quot;You're Old (Fuck You)&quot; - 0:13\n36.&quot;You Go to Art School&quot; - 0:55\n37.&quot;Your Best Friend Is You&quot; - 0:54\n38.&quot;You're in a Coma&quot; - 1:19\n39.&quot;Windchimes Are Gay&quot; - 0:11\n40.&quot;No, We Don't Want to Do a Split Seven Inch With Your Stupid Fucking Band&quot; - 0:29\n41.&quot;RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Auberjonois&quot; - 0:41\n42.&quot;The Internet is Gay&quot; - 0:25\n43.&quot;Ha Ha, Your Wife Left You&quot; - 1:12\n44.&quot;Hootie and the Blowfish&quot; - 0:39\n45.&quot;You Went to See Dishwalla and Everclear (You're Gay)&quot; - 0:23\n46.&quot;Locking Dropdead in McDonald's&quot; - 0:21\n47.&quot;Technology's Gay&quot; - 0:26\n48.&quot;Your Favorite Band is Supertramp&quot; - 0:37\n49.&quot;I'm in A.C.&quot; - 0:21\n50.&quot;You (Fill In the Blank)&quot; - 0:27\n51.&quot;Kyle From Incantation Has a Moustache&quot; - 4:10\n52.&quot;Bonus Track #3&quot; - 0:09\n\n\nSeth Putnam - vocals\nJosh Martin - guitar\nNate Linehan - drums / backing vocals on #31 and 32\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef60318a0760e7292131410d9e49595d20c7116e","amp;dn":"Anal+Cunt-+1997+-+I+Like+It+When+You+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef60318a0760e7292131410d9e49595d20c7116e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,96,49,138,7,96,231,41,33,49,65,13,158,73,89,93,32,199,17,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
