Tiger Girl (from We Were Exploding Anyway)\n\nFrom our 65Propaganda mailout:\n\n&quot;We've got quite a concise festival season this year, since we're busy in our 65 bunker, slowly but surely succumbing to agoraphobia and going deaf.\n\nNevertheless, we are thrilled to be creeping up those bills, headlining a few festivals and making our debuts in countries we've been trying to get to for years now.\n\nTo celebrate this, we're giving away a free e.p - The Last Dance - that's got a selection of tracks from our past few records. It's nothing that you can't find on the torrentz in about 30 seconds, but it's got new artwork and it flows sensibly from start to finish like an iTunes shuffle doesn't.\n\nIt's entirely possible, if you're reading this email, that you already have all these tracks. If that's the case, then thanks. What would be amazing is if you could pass this on to your friends who don't, especially if you're heading to any festivals with them this year where we'll be playing. So please share. Everywhere. It's the future.&quot;\n\n\nThe Last Dance Festival Shows 2012:\n\n12th July - Cockpit, Leeds, UK (warm-up show)\n13th July - 2000 Trees, Cheltenham\n15th July - Ilosaarirock, Joensuu, Finland\n21st July - Truck Festival, Oxford\n22nd July - Tramlines, Sheffield\n7th August - Terraneo Festival, Croatia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb55f76666a7749cbbf51e930ea9aa605eb8e9fc","amp;dn":"65daysofstatic+-+The+Last+Dance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb55f76666a7749cbbf51e930ea9aa605eb8e9fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,85,247,102,102,167,116,156,187,245,30,147,14,169,170,96,94,184,233,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
