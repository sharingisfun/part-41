Bush on November 19, 2001. Originally part of the United States Department of Transportation, the TSA was moved to the Department of Homeland Security on March 9, 2003.\n\nJohn S. Pistole is the fifth TSA Administrator, having replaced former head Kip Hawley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech Specs:\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : D:TSA - THE DOCUMENTARY [ENHANCED PAT DOWN EDITION] (2014)TSA - THE DOCUMENTARY [ENHANCED PAT DOWN EDITION] (2014).avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                           : OpenDML\nFile size                                : 2.19 GiB\nDuration                                 : 3h 10mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 643 Kbps\nWriting library                          : VirtualDub build 32842/release\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 1\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                              : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                                 : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                            : DivX 5\nDuration                                 : 3h 10mn\nBit rate                                 : 1 440 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 406 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.205\nStream size                              : 1.92 GiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : DivX 2682\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 3h 10mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 262 MiB (12%)\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 500 ms\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e1a0511c77f12deca535be8ca11184dcb621f4","amp;dn":"TSA+-+THE+DOCUMENTARY+%5BENHANCED+PAT+DOWN+EDITION%5D+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e1a0511c77f12deca535be8ca11184dcb621f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,225,160,81,28,119,241,45,236,165,53,190,140,161,17,132,220,182,33,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
