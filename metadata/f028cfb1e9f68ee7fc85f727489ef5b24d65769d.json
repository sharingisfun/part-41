It was released in 1991-1992. The game was much like the original: the player controls a paperboy (or papergirl) who must navigate a bizarre series of obstacles, such as tires rolling down a driveway while a car is being repaired, or strange houses like a haunted house, while trying to deliver the morning paper to various customers on a street (though unlike its predecessor, papers had to be delivered to houses on both sides of the street). Like the original, the game is renowned for its difficulty.\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nExtract Archive\nRun 'Paper boy 2.bat'\nProfit???\n\n\n\nTested on:\n\nWindows 7 32bit &amp; 64bit\nWindows XP 32bit &amp; 64bit\n\n\n Shouts to all the retro gamers out there!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f028cfb1e9f68ee7fc85f727489ef5b24d65769d","amp;dn":"Paper.Boy.2%5BPC%5D%5BWin7.x86.x64%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f028cfb1e9f68ee7fc85f727489ef5b24d65769d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,40,207,177,233,246,142,231,252,133,247,39,72,158,245,178,77,101,118,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
