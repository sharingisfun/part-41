ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sense of humor in the closing Ã¢â‚¬ËœCountry guitarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ moments of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lethal Thrashing MadnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a little bit of early ANTHRAX clean to mosh part riff-o-rama during Ã¢â‚¬Å“Godless WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in addition to the triplet harmony guitar action that makes Ã¢â‚¬Å“In Greed We TrustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ an instant winner.\n\nCharly as a vocalist has a melodic, clean nature but knows when to emphasize certain words for dramatic effect Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a la much of the US/ Bay Area brethren. The rhythm section knows that they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be stuck in one gear to develop a killer Thrash album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so Abel and Cheche have just as much delicacy in the tranquil instrumental sections as they do when they are asked to crank up the aggression and intensity for the faster parts. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d say overall LETHAL VICE remind me most of acts who had that late 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s finesse and slight level of technical prowess Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unafraid to throw down some meaty riffs and really awe-inspiring transitions. HEATHEN and SACRED REICH come up often to my mind for Ã¢â‚¬Å“NWOÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the fun follow up Ã¢â‚¬Å“Street ViolenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n\n\nA skull and zombie adorned cover may be a tad clichÃƒÂ© at this point in the game, so I hope that in the future the quintet are willing to spend a little extra cash in the direction of a better cover Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as the songwriting on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thrash ConvertersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ deserves an equally professional first impression art-wise. Active since 2005, this debut album gives the listener 10 tracks of classic Thrash with a musicality rarely achieved these days in the genre. Much of the new generation would be wise to not only buy this album but study the influences LETHAL VICE gravitates towards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as it is a few cuts above the typical SUICIDAL TENDENCIES/METALLICA/ SLAYER/ EXODUS worship.\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nCharly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals\nAlex Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitars\nCalo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitars\nAbel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass\nCheche Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Lethal Vice\nAlbum: Thrash Converters\nGenre: Thrash Metal,\nSubgenre: Old School Thrash\nCountry Of Origin: Spain\nYear: 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nPlaying Time: 49.05\nSize: 113 MB\n\nTracklist:\n01.
