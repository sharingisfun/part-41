Is it art, science or magic? This usefully short book will help you get the theory, practical advice and case studies you need to stop you reaching for the dice. Recently updated for 2012, with a new look and feel and a bunch of new content, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Just Roll The Dice is the freshest and most useful guide to software pricing around.\n\nAt Business of Software 2007 Michael Pryor held an impromptu session on how to price your software. So many people turned up, and so many people kept on arriving, that by the time theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d introduced themselves there was no time left to talk about software pricing. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had similar experiences; in fact, Ã¢â‚¬Å“How do I price my software?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is probably the most common question IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m asked by software entrepreneurs and product managers. This handbook is an attempt to answer that question.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8540081d10d4499089cd99579637bf7c3a45613a","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Just+Roll+The+Dice+%5BSoftware+Pricing%5D+%28efendi+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8540081d10d4499089cd99579637bf7c3a45613a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,64,8,29,16,212,73,144,137,205,153,87,150,55,191,124,58,69,97,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
