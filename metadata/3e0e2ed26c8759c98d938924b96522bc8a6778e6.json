Her life isn't empty, but it's emotionally sterile. Her Chinese maid rushes out of the house one day and disappears. Miri and her sister find themselves caring for the maidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s young Chinese son while they search for his mother.  The boy, whom they call &quot;NoodleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, speaks no English and no Hebrew, and neither of the sisters speak Chinese. The results are predictable, but the film has unexpected depth.
