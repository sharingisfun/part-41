I'm not talking about some video game where you poke buttons to shoot digital bullets at virtual zombies, no, there are enough of those, and I guarantee you the real thing won't be impressed by your XBOX 360 skills. \n\nNo this is a simulator that puts you in tough, real-world situations and says &quot;what would YOU do?&quot;.\n\nDesigned by Ed Anderson and featuring original illustration by renowned DC comics artist Matt Haley, ZDAY is a 21st century text-based adventure game that starts the player in a crowded suburb at ground zero of a full blown infection, gives him a baseball bat and says &quot;now what?&quot;. \n\nThe player is faced with one situation after another, where he is faced with choices. The game engine keeps track of every decision that he makes, and keeps a running tab on his survival chances based on those choices. By the time the game has ended, the player will either have survived and managed to escape the 'burbs, or he will have fallen victim to the hoards, roving looters, or even his own survival party!\n\nComprehensive post game analysis and results given after the player has completed the challenge provides very useful insight to what he may have done right and wrong. If the player wants to try again he can, but the game engine reshuffles many of the events so that no game is ever exactly the same.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nVersion 2.4 now supports Samsung devices, \nand Chinese Language\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mongadillo.zday&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mongadillo.zday&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26bc7ec40bcb90d1157a6a26df016ee6db17f26","amp;dn":"ZDAY+Survival+Simulator+v2.5+%5BPD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26bc7ec40bcb90d1157a6a26df016ee6db17f26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,107,199,236,64,188,185,13,17,87,166,162,109,240,22,238,109,177,127,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
