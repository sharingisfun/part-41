Take The CribsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ scrapped sessions with David Richards for Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn The Belly Of The Brazen BullÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, or Foals remixing Ã¢â‚¬ËœAntidotesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ because Dave Sitek Ã¢â‚¬Å“made it sound like it was recorded in the Grand CanyonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Both LPs were brilliant, but took a while to get there. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœbestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ producers, see, arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always the right ones.\n\nBut when you make the right decision, magic can happen. Such is the case with Ã¢â‚¬ËœMirage RockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Choosing Glyn Johns (a man who has previously twiddled knobs for The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin) could potentially have been a terrible idea, born from a need to say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes Glyn, hop on board, you legend youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ because how could you say no? Turns out bringing his old-school rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll expertise into the southern-fried fold makes for a perfect match.\n\nEnveloped in harmonies and My Morning Jacket-isms, BOH have always been a niche proposition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ capable of drawing devoted crowds, but a little too hicksville to fully pull the masses. On Ã¢â‚¬ËœMirage RockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, however, Ben Bridwell and co have been jump-started with a new swagger. The title track Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at once dreamy but, yÃ¢â‚¬â„¢know, rocking Ã¢â‚¬â€œ encapsulates it perfectly. Ã¢â‚¬ËœKnockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ opens at full pelt, BridwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warm tones gaining clout alongside rollicking guitars and one of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most fully upbeat tracks to date. The pop-ridden Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Little BiblicalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, meanwhile, is like a countryfied Beach Boys, while the sun-drenched Ã¢â‚¬ËœElectric MusicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ makes for a modern take on the EaglesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœTake It EasyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nThere are still enough highlights within its more classic Band Of Horses moments (the ridiculously Neil Young-y Ã¢â‚¬ËœDumpster WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, or Ã¢â‚¬ËœSlow Cruel Hands Of TimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and its plaintive, perfect vocals) to ensure thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no risk of the band doing a Kings Of Leon. But Ã¢â‚¬ËœMirage RockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ could and should be the LP that at least bumps them a good few places higher up next yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s festival bills.\n\n- Lisa Wright\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1aaac0d1694346f767898c3815bccec4ba118f3","amp;dn":"Band+of+Horses+-+Mirage+Rock+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1aaac0d1694346f767898c3815bccec4ba118f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,170,172,13,22,148,52,111,118,120,152,195,129,91,204,236,75,161,24,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
