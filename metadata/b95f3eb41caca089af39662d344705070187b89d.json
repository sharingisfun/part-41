Due to the wide reaching nature of the subject readers often struggle to find a book which provides in-depth, comprehensive information without focusing on one specific subject too heavily.\nHere Dr Margaret Wright provides an essential introduction to the subject guiding the reader through the basics but then going on to provide a reference which professionals will continue to dip in to through their careers. Through extensive worked examples, Dr Wright, presents the theories as to why and how reactions occur, before examining the physical and chemical requirements for a reaction and the factors which can influence these.\n* Carefully structured, each chapter includes learning objectives, summary sections and problems.\n* Includes numerous applications to show relevance of kinetics and also provides plenty of worked examples integrated throughout the text","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b95f3eb41caca089af39662d344705070187b89d","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Chemical+Kinetics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b95f3eb41caca089af39662d344705070187b89d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,95,62,180,28,172,160,137,175,57,102,45,52,71,5,7,1,135,184,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
