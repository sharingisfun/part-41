It then moves on to describe his conversion to first conservatism and then into National Socialism, providing much of the evidence along the way which he found so convincing. He describesÃ¢â‚¬â€with all the rare illustrationsÃ¢â‚¬â€his two marriages, and the ups and downs of his personal life leading up to the time in 1958, when, alone and without a penny to his name, he hoisted a swastika flag in his house in Arlington, Virginia, and announced the launch of the first openly National Socialist party in America since 1945. Rockwell was joined by a small but growing group of comrades, and, as he describes so forcefully in this book, he literally fought his way to national prominence. Soon he was addressing crowds of thousands at colleges and at his public meetings, despite the most ferocious opposition. This book, written six years before his assassination, provides a deep insight into the thoughts, actions and ideas of one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most enigmatic political figures. * The first two editions of This Time The World were hand-assembled by Rockwell and his associates in batches of no more than a few hundred copies. As the author states, the original was printed on an office duplicator and as a result, the images were of an extremely low quality. This edition contains all the original images, hand edited using up-to-date digital imaging techniques to the very best quality possible. Nonetheless, the reader will see that many of them are still far below modern printing standards. Nonetheless, the majority are quite presentable, and provide an until now unseen insight into RockwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and the early activities of his party","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c5484093ae8116bed14b372a8e019a95eee01b5","amp;dn":"This+Time+The+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c5484093ae8116bed14b372a8e019a95eee01b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,84,132,9,58,232,17,107,237,20,179,114,168,224,25,169,94,238,1,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
