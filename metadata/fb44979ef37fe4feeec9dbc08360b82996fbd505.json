On what should have been one of the happiest nights of her life, she and her boyfriend Gavin watched a nurse disconnect the ventilator from their seven-day-old baby. During the funeral two days later, Gavin walked out and never returned.\n\nSince then, her life has been a spiral of disasters. The only thing that has helped is her ability to black out whenever the pain gets too hard to bear, a habit that has become an addiction.\n\nWhen Gavin shows up in her astronomy class four years later, he is hell-bent on getting her back, insisting she forgive him. Corabelle knows she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist the touch that fills the empty ache that has haunted her since he left. But if he learns what she has done, if he follows the trail back through her past, her secrets will destroy their love completely. And once again, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll lose the only person who always believed she was innocent.\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb44979ef37fe4feeec9dbc08360b82996fbd505","amp;dn":"Forever+Innocent+-+Deanna+Roy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb44979ef37fe4feeec9dbc08360b82996fbd505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,68,151,158,243,127,228,254,238,201,219,192,131,96,184,41,150,251,213,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
