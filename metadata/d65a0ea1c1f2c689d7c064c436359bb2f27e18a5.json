Known as &quot;The King of the Jukebox&quot;, he was highly popular with both black and white audiences in the later years of the swing era. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him no. 59 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\n    Although Jordan began his career in big-band swing jazz in the 1930s, he became famous as one of the leading practitioners, innovators and popularizers of &quot;jump blues&quot;, a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of jazz, blues and boogie-woogie. Typically performed by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly syncopated vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan's band also pioneered the use of electric organ.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65a0ea1c1f2c689d7c064c436359bb2f27e18a5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+441","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65a0ea1c1f2c689d7c064c436359bb2f27e18a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,90,14,161,193,242,198,137,215,192,100,196,54,53,155,178,242,126,24,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
