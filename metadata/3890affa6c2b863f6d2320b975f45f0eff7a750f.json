Another open day was planned for 2 March 2007 where gamers got the chance to try out the new game.[3]\nThe open day was a large success in generating support from the game as this extent of customer relations is unheard of to cricket gaming fans which puts Codemasters in a positive light as a company that cares for its customers. The community liaison officer (and web editor) Peer Lawther (aka Rubbergenius) also aids this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3890affa6c2b863f6d2320b975f45f0eff7a750f","amp;dn":"Brian+Lara+International+Cricket+2007+Incl+Crack+%40+Only+By+Andre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3890affa6c2b863f6d2320b975f45f0eff7a750f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,144,175,250,108,43,134,63,109,35,32,185,117,244,95,14,255,122,117,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
