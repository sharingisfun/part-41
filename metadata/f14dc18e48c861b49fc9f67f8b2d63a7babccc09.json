The odd rock-tinged soundtrack pulls viewers through a series of obsessively staged and hauntingly realized ceremonies, movements and rituals. Experimental editing techniques, mixed with more traditional cinematic structures, add to the eerie and compelling visual quality of this avant-garde masterpiece. Marianne Faithfull, The Rolling Stones, Satanism, lightning, pyramids and extravagant costumes are only a few of the contributing elements that bring this film to a fever pitch of strangeness and cultural abstraction. Like other Anger films, LUCIFER RISING reads like a music video from outer space or Ancient Egypt or wherever the two may meet.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kenneth_anger_lucifer_rising/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kenneth_anger_lucifer_rising/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAvant-garde filmmaker, KENNETH ANGER, draws on figures from Egyptian mythology to create a mysterious atmosphere for the rise of Lucifer. Part one of an epic work not yet completed. Entertaining, slow moving, insightful, and sometimes shocking fourth installment to the KENNETH ANGER short film collection; it possesses all these attributes, as well as being influential ON experimental directors of today. A lot of what ANGER was doing in INVOCATION OF MY DEMON BROTHER (1969), (film layers, fast edits, bizarre soundtracks) can be seen in most of the music videos on MTV; a characteristic that has driven parents - as well as teenagers - crazy. The primary source of these ideas came from the Acid Trip footage, extensively explicated in Tom Wolfe&amp;#039;s lysergic-fused biographical novel, &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.&quot; Nevertheless, the idea caught on and ANGER utilized the technique to the fullest in DEMON BROTHER, counterweighted by an equivocal tape-loop supplied by MICK JAGGER. In the second film, LUCIFER RISING, ANGER had already developed his experimentation with edits and layers, this time presenting a more formalized run to the film. MARIANNE FAITHFULL makes an appearance in the film, as well as an assortment of &amp;#039;60s notables, which includes Manson-family member Bobby Beausoleil, who also wrote the film&amp;#039;s score. Although possibly not ANGER&amp;#039;S best work, - SCORPIO RISING (1964) is the better - it still has many elements that turn some people on; ergo, a cult following. Dir: KENNETH ANGER. Mus: JIMMY PAGE. Cast: KENNETH ANGER (Lucifer), DONALD CAMMELL (Osiris), MARIANNE FAITHFULL (Lilith), Myriam Gibril. 24 mins.
