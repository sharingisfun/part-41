Molly Dyer, better known as Molly Gene One Whoaman Band, is a down-home young woman, all cowboy boots and t-shirts and flannels, all soul and grit and fire. Her bottleneck slide technique is reminiscent of the old blues greats, though with a rock 'n' roll edge. Her raspy whiskey and cigarettes vocals, which do not come across as androgynous but remain entirely feminine, join together with her big plugged-in guitar sound to form songs that are as wicked as a desert rattlesnake, as sharp a straight razor, as fiery as a sip of backwoods moonshine, as sultry as summer nights in the Deep South, and nearly as sexy as Molly herself.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1  When the Train Came Along 1:48  \n2  Smells Like Low Tide 3:45  \n3  Country Lover 2:27  \n4  Stick Shift 3:10  \n5  Kiss Me Quick 2:22  \n6  Kings and Queens 5:21  \n7  Waitin' 3:26  \n8  Reformation 3:59  \n9  White Girl from Missouri 3:27  \n10  Tumbleweed 3:48  \n11  Down in Mexico 4:26  \n12  Dinks Song 5:57  \n13  Union Pacific 1:14 \n14  Uncle Sam Ain't No Lady, But He Sure Can Take Your Man 5:52 5 \n15  Outro 2:10\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98808a7b36a054e8389d226abc8c72ffbd145e2a","amp;dn":"Molly+Gene+Folk+Blues+and+Booze+%28folk+blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98808a7b36a054e8389d226abc8c72ffbd145e2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,128,138,123,54,160,84,232,56,157,34,106,188,140,114,255,189,20,94,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
