Diamandis, Steven Kotler\n2012 | ISBN: 1451614217, 1451695764 | English | 400 Pages | EPUB | 2.55 MB\n\nProviding abundance is humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandest challengeÃ¢â‚¬â€this is a book about how we rise to meet it.\n\nWe will soon be able to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp. This bold, contrarian view, backed up by exhaustive research, introduces our near-term future, where exponentially growing technologies and three other powerful forces are conspiring to better the lives of billions. An antidote to pessimism by tech entrepreneur turned philanthropist, Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler.\n\nSince the dawn of humanity, a privileged few have lived in stark contrast to the hardscrabble majority. Conventional wisdom says this gap cannot be closed. But it is closingÃ¢â‚¬â€fast. The authors document how four forcesÃ¢â‚¬â€exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, the Technophilanthropist, and the Rising BillionÃ¢â‚¬â€are conspiring to solve our biggest problems. Abundance establishes hard targets for change and lays out a strategic roadmap for governments, industry and entrepreneurs, giving us plenty of reason for optimism.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:886bd41ff6b680cfcea500a920549fc1de78c348","amp;dn":"Abundance%3A+The+Future+Is+Better+Than+You+Think","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"886bd41ff6b680cfcea500a920549fc1de78c348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,107,212,31,246,182,128,207,206,165,0,169,32,84,159,193,222,120,195,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
