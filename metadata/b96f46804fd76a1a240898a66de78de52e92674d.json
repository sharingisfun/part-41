The morning regulars thought I was out of my mind, but the more I thought about it, the more intriguing the idea seemed. Our mayor, Bernie Sanders, had established himself as a no-nonsense problem solver and someone who didnâ€™t mince words -- but not the sort of person you would imagine making a record. This paradox appealed to me.\r\n\r\nWhen I approached Bernie with the idea, he saw it as an opportunity to tell a larger story, a story about the inequities of life in America. Suddenly, the project was more than a novelty. It had purpose. Bernie chose the music: five protest songs from the fifties and early sixties. I hired arranger Don Sidney to update the songs with contemporary rhythms.\r\n\r\nAs word of the project spread among Vermontâ€™s music community, artists lined up to volunteer their talents. By the time we began recording in November 1987, I had assembled a whoâ€™s who of the Vermont music scene: Nancy Beaven, Jon Gailmor, Dick McCormack, and Joanne â€œLittle Joyceâ€ Cooper, just to name a few. Thirty artists in all.\r\n\r\nWhen we recorded the title song, We Shall Overcome, the scene was reminiscent of the Michael Jackson &quot;We Are The World&quot; session. A 21-voice chorus stood on risers in the studio. A five-piece rhythm section included some of the finest players in the area. And Bernie stood at the ready in the vocal booth with his text in hand.\r\n\r\nBernie is not a particularly musical person, but he more than made up for it with his delivery and sense of purpose. His presence in the studio electrified everyone, making this into a landmark Vermont recording.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Todd R. Lockwood, October 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b96f46804fd76a1a240898a66de78de52e92674d","amp;dn":"Bernie+Sanders+-+We+Shall+Overcome+%281978%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b96f46804fd76a1a240898a66de78de52e92674d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,111,70,128,79,215,106,26,36,8,152,166,109,231,141,229,46,146,103,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
