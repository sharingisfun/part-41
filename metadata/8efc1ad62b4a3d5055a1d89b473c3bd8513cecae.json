The city is home to a band of brothers born to defend their race: the warrior vampires of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.\n\nNow back in the Brotherhood - and unrecognisable as the vampire leader he once was - Tohrment is physically emaciated and heartbroken beyond despair. When he begins to see his beloved in his dreams - trapped in a cold, isolating netherworld - Tohr turns to a self-serving fallen angel in hopes of saving the one he has lost. When he's told he must learn to love another to free his former mate, Tohr knows they are all doomed . . .\n\nExcept then a female with a shadowed history begins to get through to him. Against the backdrop of the raging war with the lessers, and with a new clan of vampires vying for the Blind King's throne, Tohr struggles between the buried past, and a very hot, passion-filled future . . . but can his heart let go and set all of them free?\nImage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8efc1ad62b4a3d5055a1d89b473c3bd8513cecae","amp;dn":"Lover+Reborn+by+J+R+Ward+%28.MOBI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8efc1ad62b4a3d5055a1d89b473c3bd8513cecae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,252,26,214,43,74,61,80,85,161,216,155,71,60,59,216,81,60,236,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
