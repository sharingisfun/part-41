She had to put Barton Hall in order, for one thing, and to put up a notice on the door that this house was to let furnished. Then Belinda had to have a little travelling ulster and warm hat, like her mistress's, and Puff and Muff had to be settled comfortably in their new quarters; for though they did not sleep in the nursery, they were there all day, and were carried about the house by their little mistress, while Nino trotted behind. The preparations were an amusement to Dorothy, and she began to feel that if anything prevented her going to the sunny South, she would feel sorry and disappointed after all!\n\nIngleby grew more and more serious as the time drew near. She murmured a good deal about &quot;foreign parts,&quot; and once Dorothy felt sure she heard her say something about going away to die.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb55b3c9261bcef1de205766108f50b401dac94f","amp;dn":"A.Flight.With.The.Swallows-Little.Dorothy%27s.Dream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb55b3c9261bcef1de205766108f50b401dac94f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,85,179,201,38,27,206,241,222,32,87,102,16,143,80,180,1,218,201,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
