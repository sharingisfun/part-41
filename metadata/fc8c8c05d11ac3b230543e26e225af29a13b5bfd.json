It includes all relevant Maxxuss patches and\ndrivers, and allows you to install 10.4.3 8F1111A on any x86 system without hassle.\n\nAnd this is the resultant ISO file. I have burned it and booted it from a PC\nand proceeded to install OS X successfully and was able to get on the net.\n\nThis has a working iTunes program, and the other features of 8F1111A are present,\ne.g., SSE3 emulation (so just the SSE2 instructions are mandatory).\n\nPlease note there are CPUs and motherboards that are incompatible.
