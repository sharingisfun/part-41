But sometimes, it just sucks. I know. I'm Amber Dusick and I started my blog Parenting: Illustrated with Crappy Pictures because I needed a place to vent about the funny (and frustrating) day-to-day things that happened to me as a parent. Turns out, poop is hilarious! At least when you're not the one wiping it up.\n\nThis book won't make your frustrating moments any less crappy. But these stories about my Crappy Baby, Crappy Boy and my husband, Crappy Papa, will hopefully make you laugh. Because you're not alone. And sometimes the crappiest moments make the best memories. Parenting is wonderful! And also, well, you know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f563b288d5fcd98a13685a249be32307e5d1604a","amp;dn":"Parenting+-+Illustrated+with+Crappy+Pictures+-+Amber+Dusick.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f563b288d5fcd98a13685a249be32307e5d1604a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,99,178,136,213,252,217,138,19,104,90,36,155,227,35,7,229,209,96,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
