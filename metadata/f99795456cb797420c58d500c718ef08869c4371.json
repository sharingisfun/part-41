Worse, a coincidence of scheduling means that two vitally important inspections are being held at the same time, by people who expect each school to be firmly single-sex.\n\nDirector Frank Launder (who went on to helm the St Trinian's cycle) wisely begins with a slow, almost straight-faced build-up, meticulously planting comedic cluster bombs to be triggered later on as the film's high-speed farce mechanics click into gear. As the warring head teachers Wetherby Pond and Miss Muriel Whitchurch, Sim and Rutherford strike sublime comic sparks: the former is the epitome of put-upon harassment (he's not so much a misogynist as someone who feels that his life would be altogether more agreeable without a female presence of any kind above the level of domestic staff), while the latter has no truck with traditional gender roles and is only too happy to usurp Pond's authority at every opportunity. (Rutherford has a field day with a part that was specifically written for her, and which she'd already honed to perfection on stage).\n\nHowever, it's relative newcomer Grenfell as gawky, lovelorn PE teacher Miss Gossage who manages the almost inconceivable feat of upstaging them both, whether enthusiastically banging a gong (&quot;A tap, Gossage, a tap! You're not introducing a film&quot;, admonishes Miss Whitchurch), staging impromptu lacrosse matches at a second's notice or trying to chat up a horrified Nutbourne teacher (&quot;Call me Sausage&quot;).\n\nEaling's contemporaneous comedies may have been subtler and more socially relevant, but for laughs per minute they can't hold a candle to this.\n\n   The Happiest Days of Your Life.mp4\n      Format : MPEG-4\n      Format profile : Base Media\n      Codec ID : isom\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 985 Kbps\n      Encoded date : UTC 2010-07-07 03:54:27\n      Tagged date : UTC 2010-07-07 03:54:27\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n      Format profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6f270608072f235c415e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n      Format settings, CABAC : Yes\n      Format settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\n      Codec ID : avc1\n      Codec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 1 918 Kbps\n      Maximum bit rate : 6 246 Kbps\n      Width : 768 pixels\n      Height : 576 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate mode : Constant\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.173\n      Stream size : 1.06 GiB (97%)\n      Writing library : x264 core 80 r1373M 4322f63\n      Encoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.0:0.0 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=0 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / mbaff=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / wpredb=1 / wpredp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1918 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=1 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n      Encoded date : UTC 2010-07-06 19:26:29\n      Tagged date : UTC 2010-07-07 04:01:17\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AAC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\n      Format version : Version 4\n      Format profile : LC\n      Format settings, SBR : Yes\n      Format settings, PS : No\n      Codec ID : 40\n      Duration : 1h 18mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n      Maximum bit rate : 92.1 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 36.1 MiB (3%)\n      Encoded date : UTC 2010-07-07 04:01:05\n      Tagged date : UTC 2010-07-07 04:01:17","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99795456cb797420c58d500c718ef08869c4371","amp;dn":"The+Happiest+Days+of+Your+Life+%281950%29+Alastair+Sim%2C+Margaret+Rut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99795456cb797420c58d500c718ef08869c4371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,151,149,69,108,183,151,66,12,88,213,0,199,24,239,8,134,156,67,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
