Monch creates a harder sound than heard on the previous Organized Konfusion records. The album spawned the Hot 100 hit &quot;Simon Says&quot;. Monch made his highest debut on the charts, just missing the Top 40 on the Billboard 200 album chart, going on to sell over 200,000 copies. However, because of the illegal use of music from Godzilla versus Mothra as a sample in &quot;Simon Says,&quot; the album was deleted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05c259d24a45f4395284f3cac8cc74dd2a3a2db","amp;dn":"Pharoahe+Monch+-+Internal+Affairs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05c259d24a45f4395284f3cac8cc74dd2a3a2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,92,37,157,36,164,95,67,149,40,79,60,172,140,199,77,210,163,162,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
