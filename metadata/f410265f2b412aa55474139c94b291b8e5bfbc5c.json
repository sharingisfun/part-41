This book reflects the most recent changes and synthesises some of the best thinking on the subject. It provides an overview of the politics of Northern Ireland, including detailed coverage of the institutional structure under the Good Friday Agreement and an evaluation of how the institutions operated in practice.\n\nOpening with the historical context and discussion of the nature of the conflict, the standpoints of unionism, nationalism, loyalism and republicanism are explored. The evolution of political initiatives since the 1970s is traced, leading to the peace process of the 1990s and culminating in the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The period of devolution in Northern Ireland (1999-2002) will be evaluated, and the book will conclude with coverage of political developments post-suspension, paying particular attention to the on-going debate on changes to the Agreement and the prospects for power-sharing.\n\nReaders will gain:\n\nAn impartial understanding of Northern Irish politics\n\n\n# Paperback: 192 pages\n# Publisher: Edinburgh University Press (May 28, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0748625011\n# ISBN-13: 978-0748625017","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f410265f2b412aa55474139c94b291b8e5bfbc5c","amp;dn":"The+Politics+of+Northern+Ireland+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f410265f2b412aa55474139c94b291b8e5bfbc5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,16,38,95,43,65,42,165,84,116,19,156,148,178,145,184,229,191,188,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
