New Bremen, Minnesota, 1961. The Twins were playing their debut season, ice-cold root beers were at the ready at Halderson's Drug Store soda counter, and &quot;Hot Stuff &quot;comic books were a mainstay on every barbershop magazine rack. It was a time of innocence and hope for a country with a new, young president. But for thirteen-year-old Frank Drum it was a summer in which death assumed many forms. When tragedy unexpectedly comes to call on his family, which includes his Methodist minister father, his passionate, artistic mother, Juilliard-bound older sister, and wise-beyond-his years kid brother, Frank finds himself thrust into an adult world full of secrets, lies, adultery, and betrayal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e551f9dc077cde4e3c932d4e7be22cb3f1d09c","amp;dn":"William+Kent+Krueger-Ordinary+Grace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e551f9dc077cde4e3c932d4e7be22cb3f1d09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,229,81,249,220,7,124,222,78,60,147,45,78,123,226,44,179,241,208,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
