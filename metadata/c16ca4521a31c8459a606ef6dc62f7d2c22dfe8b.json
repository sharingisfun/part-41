A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey lists the top five British acts in the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s so far. The number one act is in this countdown.\n\nAt number 39 is a duo where both members have the same first name, only the second time in chart history that has ever happened.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What woman has had the most hits so far in the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s?&quot; The answer is someone who has never hit number one.\n\nThere is one band in the countdown that got their big break when a talent scout came to see a singer they were playing back-up for, and signed them instead!\n\nBecause there is whistling in the Bangles song, &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian,&quot; Casey plays a montoge of songs memorable for their whistling.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Has any artist ever hit number one as a member of more than one group?&quot;\n\nCasey tells the story of two singers who were hired after an audition which consisted of each of them singing just one note.\n\n40:    The FutureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades - Timbuk 3\n39:    Welcome To The Boomtown - David &amp; David\n38:    Foolish Pride - Daryl Hall        \n37:    Victory - Kool &amp; The Gang     \n36:    Love Is Forever - Billy Ocean     \n35:    Control - Janet Jackson    \n34:    Land Of Confusion - Genesis\n33:    Typical Male - Tina Turner\n32:    Is This Love - Survivor\n31:    All Cried Out - Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam with Full Force\n30:    You Know I Love YouÃ¢â‚¬Â¦DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You - Howard Jones\n29:    Sweet Love - Anita Baker\nLDD: DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You Forget About Me - Simple Minds    \n28:    Wild Wild Life - The Talking Heads\n27:    CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est La Vie - Robbie Nevil\n26:    What About Love - Ã¢â‚¬ËœTil Tuesday\n25:    I Am By Your Side - Corey Hart\n24:    (Forever) Live And Die - Orchestral Maneuvers In The Dark\n23:    Shake You Down - Gregory Abbott\n22:    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get Me Wrong - The Pretenders\n21:    Notorious - Duran Duran\n20:    Freedom Overspill - Steve Winwood\n19:    Stand By Me - Ben E.
