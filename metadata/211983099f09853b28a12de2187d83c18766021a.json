He posted a link to a WAV file that I, and many others, downloaded to hear. It sounds like it could be it, but I decided why not cut it, convert it, and post it here on TPB. I know it is ALAC, and many prefer FLAC, but I'm lazy. This does not belong to a specific label and GY!BE allows the free trade of their music so it should be legal. \n\nTrack Listing:\n\n12. (3:59) Random Luvly Moncton Blue(s) 747kbps\n\n13. (4:06) Dadmomdaddy 759kbps\n\nCD WAV editor for cut &amp; iTunes to convert to ALAC.\nTake it or leave it.\n\nThis is my first torrent so bare with me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:211983099f09853b28a12de2187d83c18766021a","amp;dn":"Godspeed+You%21+Black+Emperor+-+All+Lights+Fucked+on+the+Hairy+Amp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"211983099f09853b28a12de2187d83c18766021a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,25,131,9,159,9,133,59,40,161,45,226,24,125,131,193,135,102,2,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
