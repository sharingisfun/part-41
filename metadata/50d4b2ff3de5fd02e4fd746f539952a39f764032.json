In stories as darkly comic as they are unflinching, people isolated by geography, emotion, or circumstance cut imperfect paths to peaceÃ¢â‚¬â€they have no other choice. \n\nA Russian mail-order bride in Finland is rendered silent by her dislocation and loss of language, the mother of a severely disabled boy writes him postcards he'll never read on a cruise ship held hostage by pirates, and an Iowa actuary wanders among the reincarnations of those she's known in her 127 lives. Horrocks' women find no simple escapes, and their acts of faith and acts of imagination in making do are as shrewd as they are surprising.\n\nGenre: General Fiction Short Stories","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50d4b2ff3de5fd02e4fd746f539952a39f764032","amp;dn":"This+Is+Not+Your+City+by+Caitlin+Horrocks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50d4b2ff3de5fd02e4fd746f539952a39f764032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,212,178,255,61,229,253,2,228,253,116,111,83,153,82,163,159,118,64,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
