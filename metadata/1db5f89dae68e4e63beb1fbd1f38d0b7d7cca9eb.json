The Physical Universe is also accompanied by strong media component with the Connect online homework system, personal response system (&quot;clicker&quot;) questions, more extensive online quizzing, and PowerPoint lectures. Aimed at presenting the essentials of physics, chemistry, earth science, and astronomy in a clear, easy-to-understand way, The Physical Universe shows students how science works, how scientists approach problems, and why science constantly evolves in its search for understanding. The text can also be packaged with its long time companion student study guide, which includes a review of chapter terms and concepts; self quizzing for extra practice; and additional solved problems.\nAbout the Author\nKonrad B. Krauskopf was born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin and earned a B.S. in chemistry from University of Wisconsin in 1931. He then earned a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of California in Berkeley. When the Great Depression made jobs in chemistry scarce, Professor Krauskopf decided to study geology, which had long fascinated him. Through additional graduate work at Stanford University, he earned a second Ph.D. and eventually a position on the Stanford faculty. He remained at Stanford until his retirement in 1976. During his tenure, Professor Krauskopf also worked at various times with the U.S. Geological Survey, served with the U.S. army in occupied Japan, and traveled to Norway, France, and Germany on sabbatical leaves. His research interests included field work on granites and metamorphic rocks and laboratory study on applications of chemistry to geologic problems, especially the formation of ore deposits. In recent years, Professor Krauskopf had spent time working with various government agencies on the problem of radioactive waste disposal.\n\nMcGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback\n    * Publisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 14 edition (May 9, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0077546202\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0077546205","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1db5f89dae68e4e63beb1fbd1f38d0b7d7cca9eb","amp;dn":"The+Physical+Universe+14th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1db5f89dae68e4e63beb1fbd1f38d0b7d7cca9eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,181,248,157,174,104,228,230,59,235,31,189,31,56,208,183,215,204,169,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
