Road to War.\nAndrew Marr continues his rollicking account of the early 20th century, placing the era as a time of seeming innocence captured in children's classics such as The Wind in the Willows. But we shouldn't be fooled: &quot;Edwardian Britain has been covered by a golden, dappled glow,&quot; Marr tells us, reclining in a punt on a golden, dappled river. Yet &quot;Dark, angry storm clouds were brewing.&quot; The big storm was the First World War, but before that there were other rumblings - dockers' strikes and battles over women's suffrage. The jittery archive clip of Emily Wilding Davison running in front of the king's horse at Epsom is shocking to watch.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 3245 Kb/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nRun-Time: 58 mins\nFrame Rate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 1.45GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nforums dot mvgroup dot org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfff7b473e79e04411d43326a76609279b275194","amp;dn":"BBC+Andrew+Marrs+The+Making+of+Modern+Britain+2of6+HDTV+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfff7b473e79e04411d43326a76609279b275194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,255,123,71,62,121,224,68,17,212,51,38,167,102,9,39,155,39,81,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
