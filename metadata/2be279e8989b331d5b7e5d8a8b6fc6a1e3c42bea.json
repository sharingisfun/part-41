The Property Brothers come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple decides between two major renovation projects, and the brothers have just three weeks to do the job. But even before the work can begin, tough negotiations threaten the purchase of the home and drive the couple's stress levels through the roof. And when the demolition starts and quickly reveals a number of hiccups, Wyatt starts having a meltdown. Jonathan attempts to lighten the mood with some consumer therapy, but the couple can't make design decisions and the only thing Wyatt sees is the bottom line. Wyatt struggles to gain perspective while Jonathan races to make a dream home come true.\n\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2be279e8989b331d5b7e5d8a8b6fc6a1e3c42bea","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e14.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2be279e8989b331d5b7e5d8a8b6fc6a1e3c42bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,226,121,232,152,155,51,29,91,126,93,138,139,111,198,161,227,196,43,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
