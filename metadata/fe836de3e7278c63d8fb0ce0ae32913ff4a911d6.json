Good Charlotte fits this bill nicely, adding the pop niceties required to reach the mainstream. As the quintet's debut album shows, though, the brattiness is largely on the surface.\n\nOn the reggaefied &quot;Waldorfworldwide,&quot; for example, the boys get downright open-hearted, expressing their desire to party without the threat of violence. The closing &quot;Change&quot; is practically a power ballad, with lush backdrop and gently swaying rhythm. These relatively subtle contrasts don't exactly make Good Charlotte eclectic, but they do give them enough variety to remain interesting for the length of this album.\n\nAdditional Tracks\n\nRecorded at Encore, NRG, Larrabee Studios, Los Angeles, California and Battery Studios, New York, New York.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe836de3e7278c63d8fb0ce0ae32913ff4a911d6","amp;dn":"Good+Charlotte+-+Good+Charlotte+-+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe836de3e7278c63d8fb0ce0ae32913ff4a911d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,131,109,227,231,39,140,99,216,251,12,224,174,50,145,63,244,169,17,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
