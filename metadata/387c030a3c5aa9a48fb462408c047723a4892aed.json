In spite of his musical diversity and undeniable talent, he's still only really remembered for a pair of classics---the previously mentioned 1965 McCoys bubble-rock chart killer (and possibly its follow-up, a SLOOPY soundalike retread of PEGGY LEE's FEVER) and ROCK &amp; ROLL HOOCHIE KOO, which Johnny Winter also covered. Unfortunately, a wimpy 70's update of SLOOPY no fan should EVER have to endure appears on this career retrospective, although one of Derringer's few other semi-hits, a respectable cover of Warren Zevon's LAWYERS, GUNS AND MONEY is MIA. That leaves the Johnny Winter-associated (though Derringer penned) STILL ALIVE AND WELL and a dozen or so decently executed, but not overly essential other tracks of guitar antics, several from his 1974 breakthrough album ALL AMERICAN BOY. Make no mistake---the little dude can play---but at 16 selections, BEST OF could be too much unfamiliar material to digest at one sitting.\n\n\n1.  Rock And Roll, Hoochie Koo\t\n2.
