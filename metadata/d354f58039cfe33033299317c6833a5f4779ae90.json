The year is 2027. Tired and desperate, the American people are deep in the middle of The Second Great Depression. The Florida coastline is in ruins from the most powerful hurricane on record; a second just like it is bearing down on the state of Texas. For the first time in history, the Middle East has united as one and amassed the most formidable army the world has seen since the Third Reich. A hidden army of terrorists is on American soil. This is the story of three men: Howard Beck, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s richest man, also diagnosed with AspergerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Syndrome. Richard Dupree, ex-Navy SEAL turned escaped convict. Maxwell Harris, a crippled, burned out Chief of Police of a small Texas town. At first they must fight for their own survival against impossible odds. Finally, the three men must band together to save their beloved country from collapse.\n\nBOOK TWO in the New America series, entitled &quot;Resistance&quot; is slated for a summer 2013 release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d354f58039cfe33033299317c6833a5f4779ae90","amp;dn":"Collapse+%28New+America-Book+One%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d354f58039cfe33033299317c6833a5f4779ae90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,84,245,128,57,207,227,48,51,41,147,23,198,131,58,95,71,121,174,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
