That soulful Kaskade sound.\n\n\nreview:\n\nAll loops are at 126 bpm, the perfect tempo for that San Francisco house sound. Drum loops are organized into five categories: Full, Simple, Funky, Conga, and Hat. Each directory contains only ten loops, so thereÃƒÂ¢??s absolutely no room for filler. Fortunately there wasnÃƒÂ¢??t a clunker to be found. Better still, the Full and Simple loops were delightfully uncomplicated. KaskadeÃƒÂ¢??s thumbprint was on the sounds and groove, without too much processing or adornment, making these loops perfect starting points for any house production. The kicks were super-solid, and snares and claps were punchy and present. I would have no trouble using these loops in my tracks without fear of cribbing KaskadeÃƒÂ¢??s sound.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5765cad3206f2634a45a5f8ff8bc6400e1fd738d","amp;dn":"Kaskade+Sound+Library+Vol.+1%3A+House+at+126+BPM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5765cad3206f2634a45a5f8ff8bc6400e1fd738d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,101,202,211,32,111,38,52,164,90,95,143,248,188,100,0,225,253,115,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
