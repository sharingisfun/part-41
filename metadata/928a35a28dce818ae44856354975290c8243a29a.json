He goes on to explore the ideas of such figures as William of Ockham, Petrarch, Erasmus, Luther, Descartes, and Hobbes, showing that modernity is best understood as a series of attempts to formulate a new and coherent metaphysics or theology. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still trying, Gillespie contends, to resolve the tensions inherent in our ideas of God, man, and natureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½tensions that arose in the late Middle Ages during a titanic struggle between contradictory elements within Christianity. In the end, Gillespie shows that understanding modernityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s continuing entanglement with Christian metaphysics is crucial to comprehending the hidden possibilities of our confrontation with radical Islam and with the dualistic elements of our own tradition.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:928a35a28dce818ae44856354975290c8243a29a","amp;dn":"The+Theological+Origins+of+Modernity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"928a35a28dce818ae44856354975290c8243a29a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,138,53,162,141,206,129,138,228,72,86,53,73,117,41,12,130,67,162,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
