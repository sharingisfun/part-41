Image pdf with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nLife and Holiness is Thomas Merton's classic text on incorporating spirituality into everyday life. Merton here makes clear that he was a monk who knew the world. Of course, Merton lived a secular life until he became a Trappist monk in his late twenties, but even in the monastery he was deeply engaged in the questions of his day. In this succinct and readily accessible work, he offers compelling thoughts on what it means to be holy in the face of the anxieties of the modern age.\n\nFrom the Publisher\n\nIn this brief and readily accessible work, Merton offers his thoughts on what it means to be holy in the face of the anxieties of the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f430e6768312ffc06635ee2b14f4d5f1e2b2d97d","amp;dn":"Thomas+Merton+-+Life+and+Holiness+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f430e6768312ffc06635ee2b14f4d5f1e2b2d97d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,48,230,118,131,18,255,192,102,53,238,43,20,244,213,241,226,178,217,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
