Over the same time frame, Jack has advised more than seventy-five companies through private equity, and dozens more in a senior advisory role at IAC. Now, Jack and Suzy Welch draw on their experiences to address the biggest problems facing modern managementâ€”and offer pragmatic solutions to overcome them.\r\n\r\nGoing beyond theories, concepts, and ideologies, they tackle the real stuff of work today. When you get down to it, they argue, winning in business is all about mastering the gritty, inescapable, make-or-break, real-life dilemmas that define the new economy, the old economy, and everything in between. Work is a grind. We just got whacked. My boss is driving me nuts. Iâ€™m stuck in career purgatory. My team has lost its mojo. IT is holding us hostage. Our strategy is outdated the day we launch it. We donâ€™t know what our Chinese partners are talking about. Weâ€™re just not growing. These are some of the day-to-day issues the Welches take on. Coupled with Jackâ€™s years of iconic leadership and Suzyâ€™s insights as former editor of the Harvard Business Review, their new database of knowledge infuses The Real Life MBA with fresh, relevant stories and equally powerful solutions that every manager at any level can use right now","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c99a61037e2c7b5c1a2b9a5498c3248f88eaf4b","amp;dn":"The+Real-Life+MBA+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c99a61037e2c7b5c1a2b9a5498c3248f88eaf4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,153,166,16,55,226,199,181,193,162,185,165,73,140,50,72,248,142,175,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
