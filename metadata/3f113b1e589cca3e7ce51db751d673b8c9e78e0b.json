It sparked a national debate on evolution, which continues to intensify across the country. From one end of the spectrum to the other, Darwin's Black Box has established itself as the key intelligent design text -- the one argument that must be addressed in order to determine whether Darwinian evolution is sufficient to explain life as we know it.In a major new Afterword for this edition, Behe explains that the complexity discovered by microbiologists has dramatically increased since the book was first published. That complexity is a continuing challenge to Darwinism, and evolutionists have had no success at explaining it. Darwin's Black Box is more important today than ever.\n\nBuy It Here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.christianbook.com/darwins-biochemical-challenge-evolution-anniversary-edition/michael-behe/9780743290319/pd/290319?item_code=WW&amp;netp_id=792661&amp;event=ESRCN&amp;view=details&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.christianbook.com/darwins-biochemical-challenge-evolution-anniversary-edition/michael-behe/9780743290319/pd/290319?item_code=WW&amp;netp_id=792661&amp;event=ESRCN&amp;view=details&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAddress:\n140 Summit St.\nPeabody, MA 01960\nPhone:\n1-800-CHRISTIAN (1-800-247-4784)\nInternational Callers: 978-977-5000\n\nRipped from conspriacyhub.com from member Castiel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f113b1e589cca3e7ce51db751d673b8c9e78e0b","amp;dn":"Darwin%5C%27s+Black+Box+-+10th+Anniversary+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f113b1e589cca3e7ce51db751d673b8c9e78e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,17,59,30,88,156,202,62,124,229,29,183,81,214,115,184,201,231,142,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
