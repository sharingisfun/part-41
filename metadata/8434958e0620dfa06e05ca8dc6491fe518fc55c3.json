It was composed by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock, and performed by Kenny Loggins.\n\nMoroder originally asked Bryan Adams to record this song, but he was said to have rejected it because he had disliked the jingoism expressed in Top Gun. The rock group Toto was also supposed to perform the song, but due to legal matters, it was passed to Loggins.\n\nThe second single released from the Top Gun soundtrack, \\&quot;Danger Zone\\&quot; was a commercial success, peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song continues to be popular today, continuing in heavy rotation on Classic Rock radio stations in the United States.\n\nDann Huff, lead vocalist and guitarist from \\'80s Hard Rock group Giant recorded guitar for the track.\n\nThe song was featured in the films Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, Sex Drive and 17 Again, the episode \\&quot;Eight Misbehavin\\&quot; of the television series The Simpsons, in the episode \\&quot;Slutty Pumpkin\\&quot; from the television series How I Met Your Mother, and in the trailer for Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius.\n\n\n..................................................................................\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive 25.All My torrents are here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Hyperdrive25&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Hyperdrive25&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRemember To Keep Seeding.
