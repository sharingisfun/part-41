There have been enough remarkable performances to\nfill several CDs, so hopefully this disc is the first in a\nseries, but even if it isn't, there's plenty of great music on\nthis 14-track album to make it satisfying. Not everything here\nwill suit the tastes of every listener, but there are a number of\nwonderful moments, whether it's one-off duets from Elvis Costello\nand Burt Bacharach (&quot;God Give Me Strength&quot;), Lyle Lovett and Al\nGreen (&quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;) Jerry Garcia and David\nGrisman (&quot;Friend of the Devil&quot;), Jewel and Flea (&quot;You Were Meant\nfor Me&quot;) and Van Morrison, Sinad O'Connor and the Chieftains\n(&quot;Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?&quot;) or dynamic\nperformances from R.E.M. (&quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot;), Sheryl Crow\n(&quot;Strong Enough&quot;), Lenny Kravitz (&quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot;), Rod\nStewart (&quot;Reason to Believe&quot;) and Patti Smith (&quot;Who Do You\nLove&quot;). The end result is one of the few soundtracks that is more\nthan a memento.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98051d55dd0f5986e4e48edadcba2cdfad2e0c7f","amp;dn":"VA-Live+On+Letterman+Music+From+The+Lateshow-OST-CD-FLAC-1997-FO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98051d55dd0f5986e4e48edadcba2cdfad2e0c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,5,29,85,221,15,89,134,228,228,142,218,220,186,44,223,173,46,12,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
