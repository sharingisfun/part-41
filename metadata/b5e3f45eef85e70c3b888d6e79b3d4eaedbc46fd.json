From a cemetery in a mythical small town, the dead speak the truths about their lives. Some speak of hardships and sordidness; others, of their simple, honest, happy lives. Some are elderly and others are youthful or children; mortality has claimed them all. Their voices reach us deeply, alternately plaintive, anguished, enigmatic, angry, contemptuous, and comedic, evoking themes of love and hope, disappointment, despair, and abiding faith. As the Spoon River residents examine their lives, they invite us to do the same.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e3f45eef85e70c3b888d6e79b3d4eaedbc46fd","amp;dn":"POETRY+Edgar+Lee+Masters+Spoon+River+Anthology+%28Unabr%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e3f45eef85e70c3b888d6e79b3d4eaedbc46fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,227,244,94,239,133,231,12,59,136,141,110,121,179,212,234,237,188,70,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
