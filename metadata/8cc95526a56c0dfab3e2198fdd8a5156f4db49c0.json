She wants to help a group of former soldiers get their confidence back and win the battle for a job. \r\nShe soon gathers that part of the problem is perception; some potential employers consciously or unconsciously regard those with a military background as liable to be &quot;mad, bad or sad&quot;. \r\nEx-guardsman Phil says, &quot;It's like you're a mass murderer who's just come out of prison&quot;. Phil was one of the pallbearers at Princess Diana's funeral but since leaving the Army, he has struggled to hold down a job. For Stuart, the military is the only life he has known as an adult, but as Polizzi observes, &quot;The Army teaches learned helplessness.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  1 \r\nPart one of two. The cases of four veterans, all discharged from the army with mental illness, who despite having a highly trained military skill set cannot find employment in a civilian capacity. Alex learns how psychological injury can severely affect self-confidence at the very time when work could dramatically aid recovery, so sets about promoting to employers that military veterans are a valuable and untapped resource. However, as the group takes its first steps into employment she begins to think she may have bitten off more than she can chew.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nHaving completed her attempt to pair up four ex-soldiers suffering from post traumatic stress with potential employers, the presenter furthers her ambitions to connect those people offering jobs with military veterans seeking work. In the second of two programmes, she seeks to pilot a scheme in Plymouth that if successful could be rolled out across the rest of the country to help the 120,000 working-age veterans across the UK who find themselves unemployed and apparently unwanted on civvy street.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/83/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dc/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f3/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/65/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Alex-Polizzi-Hire-Our-Heroes-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2995 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/dv922z/alex-polizzi-hire-our-heroes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cc95526a56c0dfab3e2198fdd8a5156f4db49c0","amp;dn":"BBC+Alex+Polizzi+Hire+Our+Heroes+Series+1+1of2+720p+x264+AAC+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cc95526a56c0dfab3e2198fdd8a5156f4db49c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,201,85,38,165,108,13,250,179,226,25,143,221,138,81,86,244,219,73,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
