I'd post this movie with its original soundtrack (narration and cheesy music) but the fact is that I don't own it anymore. All I have is this disc I made using the Grateful Dead's Dicks Picks #28 (recorded February 1973 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Salt Lake City, Utah).  Pretty good musical soundtrack, beginning with &quot;Dark Star&quot; and ending with &quot;We Bid You Goodnight.&quot; In between, some very cool music to see a film with.\n\nAfter a while you'll forget that the movie &amp; the music don't belong together.\n\nThere is a &quot;Mondo Cane Collection&quot; torrent on Pirate Bay (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4785689/Mondo.Cane.Collection.DVDRip.1962-1971.%5B5.Movies%5D.%5BGS%5D) but it's missing WOMEN OF THE WORLD!  Which is part of the collection! I know because that's how I acquired it.\n\nEnjoy responsibly and please share. Thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce549b529e1ac09b7d92826731c5aec2603fa9ef","amp;dn":"Women+of+the+World+%28Grateful+Dead+soundtrack%29+-+revised","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce549b529e1ac09b7d92826731c5aec2603fa9ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,84,155,82,158,26,192,155,125,146,130,103,49,197,174,194,96,63,169,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
