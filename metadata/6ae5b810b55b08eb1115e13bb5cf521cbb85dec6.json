During his interview with Donald Trump, Trump told him he was aware of the New World Order. &quot;There's something real&quot; about his campaign, and &quot;the establishment is scared of him because he's spent no political money,&quot; said Jones, who added that since Trump's got the globalists so upset, he's decided to cautiously support his candidacy. Jones also announced that he was pleased that a lot of the issues which he, George, and Coast to Coast have been bringing to light over the last decade plus are now more widely known.\r\n\r\nHe described the Illuminati as cultural shape-shifters, with a Jekyll &amp; Hyde demeanor. &quot;They want a planetary government. They want humans dependent on the system. They want seeds that don't produce new seeds. They want humans sterile, so you have to have a test tube baby. They want control of the reproductive system of humans, animals, and plants.&quot; He shared details of his interview with Vivian Kubrick, the daughter and protege of the late filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who told him that everything in her father's last film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (about a powerful secret society) was basically real.\r\n \nhttp://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2016/05/11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ae5b810b55b08eb1115e13bb5cf521cbb85dec6","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Illuminati+Coast+to+Coast+May+12%2C2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ae5b810b55b08eb1115e13bb5cf521cbb85dec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,229,184,16,181,91,8,235,17,21,225,59,181,207,82,28,187,133,222,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
