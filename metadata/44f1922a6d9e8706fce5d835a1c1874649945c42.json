You know the dangers-a growl if you throw them a compliment and a roar if you ever look for thanks!\n\nLions are the people in all organizations who wield power and influence. They act differently because they think differently. But that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that they have to be difficulty to work with! Lion Taming will help you get inside their minds, so you can communicate and work more effectively together.\n\nBased on in-depth interviews and research into real lion tamers as well as the experiences of numerous people at all levels of the workplace, Steven L Katz shows how the secrets of the center ring can lead to a great performance in the office.\n\nPrey, the Enemy or Ignored: Lions make an instinctive calculation the minute any living thing comes into view: You are either prey, the enemy, or ignored. Lion Taming shows you how to avoid all three of these and earn a place in the pride.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f1922a6d9e8706fce5d835a1c1874649945c42","amp;dn":"Lion+Taming%3A+Working+Successfully+with+Leaders%2C+Bosses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f1922a6d9e8706fce5d835a1c1874649945c42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,241,146,42,109,158,135,6,252,229,216,53,161,193,135,70,73,148,92,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
