Kathy jokingly calls cribs Ã¢â‚¬Å“cages,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and says both of her children share the bed with her and her husband.\n\nHelicopter Granny Crossing the Line?\n\nSelf-professed helicopter grandmother Joann says thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing she wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do to check up on her children and grandchildren, including climbing over locked gates to break into her 39-year-old daughter, AngieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, home. Will she agree to give her daughter some space?\n\nVerbal Lashing on Video\n\nLavaniel posted a video on Facebook andof him verbally bashing his then 15-year-old son, Lavaniel Jr., for his wardrobe choice.
