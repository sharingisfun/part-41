On her way to Maine she is thrown off course by a weird corrosion of the ground, which sends her car over a ledge and dangling off the side of a cliff. Luckily, officer Nathan from the local police department is around and quickly ejects her from the car as it slides down onto the jagged rocks. The two of them quickly develop a friendship and take on Lester's case.\n\nShortly after, they discover that Lester is dead, but their mission is not over just yet. They need to find out who killed him and why. The unlikely duo finds out later that Lester was thrown off a cliff on Edgewater beach by a powerful unknown force. Nathan immediately suspects Conrad Brower; the man Lester stole a fortune from years ago. Of course Conrad denies any involvement and in the midst of his interrogation a mysterious, a dark cloud appears and Conrad disappears.\n\nNathan then considers a childhood acquaintance by the name of Duke for the crime. But in an odd twist of fate, Duke later saves Audrey after she's thrown into the ocean by an electric volt during a sudden hailstorm. Surely someone this heroic wouldn't kill anybody. Right? Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAfter being one of the few to survive a deadly storm, Maryanne inherited over 2million dollars and Lester broke out of jail to steal it from her. But the plot thickens Ã¢â‚¬â€ Lester had a partner, Maryanne's boyfriend Ted, who convinced her to move to San Diego. He gained access to her account and claimed that he would make a down payment on a new building. Instead he wiped out her bank account and planned to run off with the money. Before he could leave town, Maryanne confronted him and her anger allowed her to alter the weather, an unknown special power of hers (crazy fog and thunderstorms from earlier? Yep, all caused by Maryanne).\n\nDuring the big climax, Ted is taken down with the help of Audrey and Nathan. And although Maryanne is the one who killed Lester with her powers, Audrey goes easy on her since it was kinda (sorta) an accident.\n\nWith this solved, Audrey decides to stay in Haven a little while longer to crack the case of her own identity that may end up being linked to this peculiar town.\n\nWeer een 2Lions-Team Release\n\nHAAK NIET AF NA HET DOWNLOADEN, LAAT ANDEREN MEE GENIETEN EN SEED 2X OF MEER\nAL VAST BEDANKT\n\nDON'T SHUTOFF AFER DOWNLOADING, BUT SEED 2X OR MORE\nMANY THANKS\n\n*****************************************\nBrought to you by \n2Lions Team\n\nmeer zien??\nKom dan eens kijken op ons forum \n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.2lions.ons-forum.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.2lions.ons-forum.nl&lt;/a&gt;\n******************************************\n\n\n******************************************************\nThere are fake torrents from uploaders who use our team name.\nThose are not ours, or members from our team.\nWe 2Lions-Team are not responsible for the fake posts on our name\n\nWij 2Lions-Team zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor die zieke FAKE posten die op onze naam worden gedaan\n\nPlease check our site !!!\nto the fakers , get a life !!!\n***************************************************** \n\nEnjoy \n2Lions-Team","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a2069a347c5308a170d3396c9e0ad224a2960a","amp;dn":"Haven+S01E01+2Lions-Team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a2069a347c5308a170d3396c9e0ad224a2960a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,162,6,154,52,124,83,8,161,112,211,57,108,158,10,210,36,162,150,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
