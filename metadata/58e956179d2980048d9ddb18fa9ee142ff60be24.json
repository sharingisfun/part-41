Our todo list for the public beta release alone is several pages long, and we expect the beta to be much longer.\n\nIn order to ensure players can thoroughly enjoy Electrodynamics the way we intended them to, I have been putting together a website that will contain all the info you need; recipes, ore and world gen, multiblocks, armor and much more. There will be no lack of documentation, I can assure you.\n\nThe site is currently being updated so feel free to keep an eye on it for a sneak peak at upcoming features. For those of you who didn't know we had a website, I tried to make it a little more clear...\n\nwww.electrodynamicsmod.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e956179d2980048d9ddb18fa9ee142ff60be24","amp;dn":"Electrodynamics-Alpha-0.1.2.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e956179d2980048d9ddb18fa9ee142ff60be24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,233,86,23,157,41,128,4,141,157,219,24,250,158,225,66,255,96,190,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
