Stafraenn\nHakon is the pseudonym of Olafur Josephsson, and &quot;Gummi&quot; is his fourth album release for UK indie Resonant - the first two effectively being full\nreleases for his bedroom recordings.\n\nWhile &quot;Ventill/Poki&quot; represented his first material recorded with a supporting cast - a progression that was very evident in comparison to his previous output - &quot;Gummi&quot; marks a further giant leap forward in every respect. \n\nHaving established himself as a predominantly instrumental artist, Josephsson will surprise many with the inclusion of six full vocal tracks among the nine included here - featuring Birgir Hilmarsson (Blindfold/Ampop) on five tracks and Efterklang's Casper Clausen on one, alongside other guest musicians and collaborators.\n\nWhile recognising the need to constantly evolve in order to maintain and expand upon your audience, the key elements that have always marked out Stafraenn Hakon from the crowded post-rock platform are still very much in place; delicate, intricate instrumentation and atmospherics, building slowly and organically, drawing in the listener.\n\nSure to be his biggest album to date, &quot;Gummi&quot; is housed in a full colour CD wallet featuring stunning hand-drawn artwork, and will be supported by UK tour dates around the release.\n \n\nSongs / Participants:\n\nJÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rn  (ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: guitars, bass, piano, banjo, acoustic guitar, bell\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rus: earth harp, church organ, bells\nDaniel: drums, tamborine, glitches, synths\nBirgir: pump organ\n\nSvefn (written by SamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºel White &amp; ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson, lyrics by Birgir Hilmarsson)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: Guitars, Bass, Piano, Acoustic Guitar, Synths, backing voices\nSamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºel: Guitar\nDaniel: Drums, Glitches, Guitar, Bass, Synths, backing voices, Bells\nBirgir: vocals, bass\nTÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ddi: Trombone\n\nP-rofi (written by SamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºel White &amp; ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: Guitars, Bass, Harp, Vibraphone, Acoustic Guitar\nSamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºel: Guitar\nCasper: vocals, melodica, piano, drums\nMads: instruments programming, noises, glitches &amp; reconstruction\nDaniel: glitches\nDoddi: Cello\n\nRjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºpa (written by ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson, words by Birgir Hilmarsson)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: Guitars, Bass, Banjo, mandolin, melodica, acoustic guitar, vibraphone\nBirgir: Vocals\nIngibjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rg: piano\nGreg Haines: Accordian\nDaniel: Drums, mandolin\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rus: Bells\n\nHausi( written by SamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºel White &amp; ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson, words by Minco Eggersman)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: Guitars, Bass, Piano, Acoustic Guitar, Bells, backing vocals\nSamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºel: Guitar\nMinco: Vocals                                                             \nDaniel: Drums, B4 organ, Electric Piano\nDoddi: Cello\nTÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ddi: Trombone\n\nKvef (written by ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson, words by Birgir Hilmarsson)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: Guitars, Piano, Synths, Drum Programming, Glockenspiel, Harp, B4 Organ\nBirgir: Vocals\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rus: Bells\nDaniel: Drums\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¾urr ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¾urr (written by ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson, words by Daniel Lovegrove)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: Guitars, Bass, Piano, Pump Organ, Acoustic Guitar, Dulcimer Harp, Synths, Glitches\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rus: Bells, Acoustic Guitar\nDaniel: Vocals, Glitches, Drum Programming\n\nGlussi (written by ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson &amp; Daniel Lovegrove)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: Guitars, Bass, Piano, B4 Organ, Glitches, Electric Piano\nDaniel: Drums, Bass, Guitars, Synths\n\nVeggur (written by ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur Josephsson)\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafur: Guitars, Bass, Piano, Glockenspiel, Synths\nDaniel: Drums, Bass, Glitches,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b9058d211461ff56394cc7d2998841c558d4a9c","amp;dn":"Stafraenn+Hakon+-+Gummi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b9058d211461ff56394cc7d2998841c558d4a9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,144,88,210,17,70,31,245,99,148,204,125,41,152,132,28,85,141,74,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
