With songs such as &quot;Maybellene&quot; (1955), &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (1956),\n&quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (1957) and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; (1958), Chuck Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and\nutilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.\n\n\nChuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1)\n\n01  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Maybellene (Single Version)\n02  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Wee Wee Hours\n03  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Thirty Days\n04  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - You Can't Catch Me (Single Version)\n05  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Downbound Train (Single Version)\n06  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - No Money Down (Single Version)\n07  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Brown Eyed Handsome Man (Single Version)\n08  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Roll Over Beethoven (Single Version)\n09  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Too Much Monkey Business\n10  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Havana Moon (Single Version)\n11  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - School Day (Ring Ring Goes The Bell) (Single Version)\n12  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Rock And Roll Music (1958 Single Version)\n13  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Oh Baby Doll (1957 Single Version)\n14  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Sweet Little Sixteen (Original Demo)\n15  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Guitar Boogie\n16  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Reelin' And Rockin'\n17  Chuck Berry - Gold (Disc 1) - Johnny B.
