Now, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looking forward to a night of margaritas and man-bashing. TashaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends have other plans, including Leather, Lace and liberation.\n\nDylan Caprese didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to go to Marquee, but he and his friends were on a mission. They took it upon themselves to make sure things didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get out of hand when wannabe Doms mixed alcohol with playtime at the monthly Leather and Lace night.\n\nFrom the moment he set eyes on Tasha, he knew there was something different about her. She wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t some bondage babe who thought she knew what it meant to be into BDSM. She was much, much worse; she was innocent and trusting. He can tell she is something precious.\n\nWhen TashaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past threatens to destroy her, Dylan begins to realize that while their paths have never crossed, their lives most definitely have. Will he be able to save her before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14499bb8bf1f96a16ea236738e0e1fbdfee39d7f","amp;dn":"Sloan+Johnson+-+Unexpected+Angel+%28Isthmus+Alliance+_1%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14499bb8bf1f96a16ea236738e0e1fbdfee39d7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,73,155,184,191,31,150,161,110,162,54,115,142,14,31,189,254,227,157,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
