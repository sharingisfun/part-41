Educational : MP3/64Kbps : English\n\n\nHere's a compilation of Melvyn Bragg's In Our Time program, from 2002 to present day. It's on BBC Radio 4 every Thursday.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Our_Time_(BBC_Radio_4)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Our_Time_(BBC_Radio_4)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt's probably one of the most intellectual programs on radio anywhere, and doesn't date. The usual format consistents of three academics discussing an episode or event in the history of ideas. Both the humanities and the sciences are covered, with the host Melvynn Bragg keeping the academics on topic and trying to reconcile differences of opinion.\n\nGuests include Allan Chapman, Peter Watson, Simon Schaffer, Jocelyn Bell, Martin Rees, Roger Penrose, etc.\n\nEach program runs for about 40 minutes.\n\nAlso included is the four part 2009 special on Charles Darwin commemorating his 200th birthday.\n\nThey are compiled from web downloads and recordings from Digital Radio, etc. Sound quality improves over the years due to higher sampling rates. If anyone has the episodes from 1998 - 2001, I've love to have a listen.\n\nSome recent topics include the vacuum, the Library of Alexandria, Jonathan Swift, time, and heat.\n\nThe home page is here...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a770829d6f551c505764e224feefe6679a637cc2","amp;dn":"In+Our+Time+-+2002-2009+%28BBC+Radio+Documentaries%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a770829d6f551c505764e224feefe6679a637cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,112,130,157,111,85,28,80,87,100,226,36,254,239,230,103,154,99,124,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
