After fading from the pop music scene in the mid-60's, he made some bad investments and had some marital difficulties. He credited his faith with seeing him through some hard times. Pat and his wife Shirley had four daughters: Cherry, Lindy, Debby, and Laury. In the 60's and 70's the Boone family toured as gospel singers and made gospel albums, such as The Pat Boone Family and The Family Who Prays. From 1975 to 1980 he recorded more gospel albums on the Lamb &amp; Lion label, such as Born Again and Golden Hymns. Pat also had a number of country hits in the 70's, with singles Indiana Girl and Texas Woman and albums I Love You More And More Each Day and The Country Side Of Pat Boone. Pat has always been popular in the UK, where he had 27 records reach the top forty, only one of which made number one. That was I'll Be Home in 1956.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24727fb17072716c6013561e6ed07935ec8c7f95","amp;dn":"Pat+Boone+-+The+Fifties+Collection+CD+5+of+6+%5B1997%2F192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24727fb17072716c6013561e6ed07935ec8c7f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,114,127,177,112,114,113,108,96,19,86,30,110,208,121,53,236,140,127,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
