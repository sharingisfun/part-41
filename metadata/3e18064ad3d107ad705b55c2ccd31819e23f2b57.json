It was recorded in loosely organized sessions that limited Coltrane to standards and blues, but gave him freedom in their arrangement and execution. This spontaneity shows up in the free, loose (but never aimless) versions of &quot;Lover&quot; and &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine,&quot; on which Coltrane is joined by the emerging trumpeter Donald Byrd.\n\nAn underlying impression of the musicians&amp;#039; familiarity with the material lends these tunes a unified feeling, while Coltrane&amp;#039;s unique expression also shines through. &quot;By the Numbers&quot; features a compelling solo by pianist Red Garland, whose blues themes are ultimately picked up and explored even further by Coltrane himself. &quot;Slowtrane&quot; is a deeper, more melancholy exploration of the blues.\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Coltrane ? tenor saxophone\nDonald Byrd ? trumpet \nRed Garland ? piano \nPaul Chambers ? bass \nEarl May ? bass\nArt Taylor ? drums \n\nRecorded August 16, 1957 January 10, 1958 and March 26, 1958 in Hackensack, NJ.\n\nTrack listing:\n1.
