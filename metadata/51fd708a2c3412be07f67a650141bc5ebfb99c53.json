No need for\ncompatibility mode.\n\nThese files are not from the CD, but are the actual game files. \nThe Marble Drop installer is 16-bit, which means it doesn't run\non 64-bit OSes.\n\nTo play the game:\n1. Run the marbledrop.reg file. This only has to be done once.\n2. Start marble.exe!\n\nThe game still suffers from the &quot;black screen on startup&quot;-bug.\nThis is fixed by dragging the window out of sight and then back\nagain.\n\nI don't think there are any other game-breaking bugs, if you can\nfind any, please post about them in the comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51fd708a2c3412be07f67a650141bc5ebfb99c53","amp;dn":"Marble+Drop+%2Fw+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51fd708a2c3412be07f67a650141bc5ebfb99c53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,253,112,138,44,52,18,190,7,246,122,101,1,65,188,94,191,185,156,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
