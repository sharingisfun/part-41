This book provides the necessary introduction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ derived from the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s many year of experience in teaching the subject ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that will be the starting point for serious work.\nThe dozens of projects collected here are a combination of observations suitable for current research (such as classifying sun-spots or monitoring binary stars) and recreating classic experiments (such as determining the speed of light by timing JupiterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moons). ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Besides ample nuggets for science projects, a motivated amateur will gain understanding by doing the work, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ add purpose to his or her observations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b678f9a45f02c1fa100a3da1ed3d4157d94bdf82","amp;dn":"Real+Astronomy+with+Small+Telescopes+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b678f9a45f02c1fa100a3da1ed3d4157d94bdf82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,120,249,164,95,2,193,250,16,10,61,161,237,61,65,87,217,75,223,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
