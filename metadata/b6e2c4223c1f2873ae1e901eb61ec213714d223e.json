ExxonMobil's annual \nrevenues are larger than the economic activity in the great majority of \ncountries. In many of the countries where it conducts business, ExxonMobil's \nsway over politics and security is greater than that of the United States \nembassy. In Washington, ExxonMobil spends more money lobbying Congress and the \nWhite House than almost any other corporation. Yet despite its outsized \ninfluence, it is a black box. \n\nPrivate Empire pulls back the curtain, tracking the corporation's recent history \nand its central role on the world stage, beginning with the Exxon Valdez \naccident in 1989 and leading to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of \nMexico in 2010. The action spans the globe, moving from Moscow, to impoverished \nAfrican capitals, Indonesia, and elsewhere in heart-stopping scenes that feature \nkidnapping cases, civil wars, and high-stakes struggles at the Kremlin. \n\nAt home, Coll goes inside ExxonMobil's K Street office and corporation \nheadquarters in Irving, Texas, where top executives in the &quot;God Pod&quot; (as \nemployees call it) oversee an extraordinary corporate culture of discipline and \nsecrecy. \n\nThe narrative is driven by larger-than-life characters, including corporate \nlegend Lee &quot;Iron Ass&quot; Raymond, ExxonMobil's chief executive until 2005. A close \nfriend of Dick Cheney's, Raymond was both the most successful and effective oil \nexecutive of his era and an unabashed skeptic about climate change and \ngovernment regulation. This position proved difficult to maintain in the face of \nnew science and political change, and Raymond's successor, current ExxonMobil \nchief executive Rex Tillerson, broke with Raymond's programs in an effort to \nreset ExxonMobil's public image. The larger cast includes countless world \nleaders, plutocrats, dictators, guerrillas, and corporate scient... \n\nÃ¢Å’ï¿½2012 Steve Coll; (P)2012 Penguin\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6e2c4223c1f2873ae1e901eb61ec213714d223e","amp;dn":"Private.Empire.ExxonMobil.and.American.Power.by.Steve.Coll.aBOOK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6e2c4223c1f2873ae1e901eb61ec213714d223e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,226,196,34,60,31,40,115,174,30,144,30,182,30,194,19,113,77,34,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
