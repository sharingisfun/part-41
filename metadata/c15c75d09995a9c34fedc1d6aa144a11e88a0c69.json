The comic marks Charlie Adlard's 100th consecutive issue.\n\nAMC's The Walking Dead, which was renewed for a fourth season without showrunner Glen Mazzara, returns Feb. 10.\n\n------\n\nThis might be the first time I've ever posted a 2nd version of the same comic, but these Minutemen releases 1) are both different resolutions from the Empire release and 2) include the alternate cover (see picture) celebrating Charlie Adlard's 100th issue drawing The Walking Dead.  --STFmaryville\n\n------\n\nI stole the following from a blackcanary torrent!\n\nThis torrent includes both 1440px and 2048px-HD versions  \n*Note: You can download both or only choose which version you'd prefer by deselecting the one you don't want when you add the torrent to your client software.  If you're adding the torrent via magnet link, you can deselect any undesired file in the list of files once the torrent has begun downloading.\n========================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c15c75d09995a9c34fedc1d6aa144a11e88a0c69","amp;dn":"THE+WALKING+DEAD+106+%282013%29+%28c2c%29+%281440px+and+2048px-HD%29+%28Minute","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c15c75d09995a9c34fedc1d6aa144a11e88a0c69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,92,117,208,153,149,169,195,79,237,193,214,170,20,74,17,232,138,12,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
