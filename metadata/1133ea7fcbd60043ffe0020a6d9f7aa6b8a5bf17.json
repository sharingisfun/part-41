Offering an in-depth overview of the migraine mechanism, including discussions of the neurogenic, vascular, platelet, and serotonin related components of the process, this source supplies extensive illustrations of the neuroanatomical structures involved in migraine and the latest insights from functional neuroimaging using BOLD fMRI and PET.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1133ea7fcbd60043ffe0020a6d9f7aa6b8a5bf17","amp;dn":"Migraine+%28Neurological+Disease+and+Therapy%29-E+BOOK+SHAREGO.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1133ea7fcbd60043ffe0020a6d9f7aa6b8a5bf17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,51,234,127,203,214,0,67,255,224,2,10,109,159,122,166,184,165,191,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
