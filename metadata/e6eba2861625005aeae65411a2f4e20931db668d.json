Intense close quarters confrontations, high lethality, tactics, team play, and explosive action are at the center of the experience. The gameplay sets a new bar for intense firefights and expert strategy in the rich legacy of past Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six games.\r\nKey Features\r\nTHE SIEGE GAMEPLAY \r\nFor the first time in Rainbow Six, players will engage in sieges, a brand-new style of assault. Enemies now have the means to transform their environments into strongholds: they can trap, fortify, and create defensive systems to prevent breach by Rainbow teams. \r\n\r\nTo face this challenge, players have a level of freedom unrivaled by any previous Rainbow Six game. Combining tactical maps, observation drones, and a new rappel system, Rainbow teams have more options than ever before to plan, attack, and diffuse these situations. \r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER TERRORIST UNITS \r\nCounter terrorist operatives are trained to handle extreme situations, such as hostage rescue, with surgical precision. As â€œshort rangeâ€ specialists, their training is concentrated on indoor environments. Operating in tight formations, they are experts of close quarter combat, demolition, and coordinated assaults. Rainbow Six Siege will include operators coming from five of the most worldwide renowned CTU: the British SAS, the American SWAT, the French GIGN, the German GSG9 and the Russian SPETSNAZ. \r\n\r\nThese Operators are specialists with their own expertise within Siege operations. Each has their own unique personality &amp; specialty. Some are focused on assault where as others are defense-oriented. They can be combined within the same team to create new team strategies. \r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL DESTRUCTION \r\nDestruction is at the heart of the siege gameplay. Players now have the unprecedented ability to destroy environments. Walls can be shattered, opening new lines of fire, and ceiling and floors can be breached, creating new access points. Everything in the environment reacts realistically, dynamically, and uniquely based on the size and caliber of bullets you are using or the amount of explosives you have set. In Rainbow Six Siege, destruction is meaningful and mastering it is often the key to victory.\r\n\r\nInstall &amp; Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6eba2861625005aeae65411a2f4e20931db668d","amp;dn":"Tom+Clancy%27s+Rainbow+Six-+Siege+%5BUpdate+1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6eba2861625005aeae65411a2f4e20931db668d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,235,162,134,22,37,0,90,234,230,84,17,162,244,226,9,49,219,102,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
