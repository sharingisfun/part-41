The volume is going up and down almost as if someone (Healy) is purposely messing with the mix. I didn't hear it until I listened to it with headphones.\n\n\nREVIEWER: Folkhippy -  - September 20, 2009\nOut of all the amazing years in Dead history prior, who knew that the odd year of 1977 would shine so bright? I'm sure not even the Dead could predict the musical genius the would flourish and climax in the Spring of 1977. This show is one of the greatest of a year that can only be described as heavenly. The Terrapin&gt; Playin'&gt; Samson&gt; Playin' alone make this a top show! Jerry is noodling way out in the atmosphere and Keith is using his Moog keyboard to evoke pure emotion. This show is up there with the 5/7-9/77 concerts. This show is for sure 5 stars for sound, recording, and performance! I'm listing to the Playin' suite on a lazy Sunday afternoon...ahhhhhhh. God bless the Grateful Dead!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9d29b89adc288e5fe6bf4cb740d97f3bf765d5","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1977-03-19+-+Winterland+in+San+Francisco%2C+CA++SB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9d29b89adc288e5fe6bf4cb740d97f3bf765d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,157,41,184,154,220,40,142,95,230,191,76,183,64,217,127,59,247,101,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
