Charlap's boppish yet melodic style (which is championed by George Shearing in the liner notes) is pleasing, swinging and just unpredictable enough to hold one's interest. He mostly performs lesser-known standards such as Vernon Duke's &quot;Roundabout,&quot; Irving Berlin's &quot;The Best Thing For You Would Be Me&quot; and the Rodgers and Hart classic &quot;Nobody's Heart.&quot; An enjoyable outing.
