It objectively and methodically documents the hidden alliance between new versions and the New Age Movement's One World Religion.\n\nThe emerging 'new' Christianity - with its substitution of riches for righteousness, a crown for a cross, and an imitation for a new creation - is shown to be a direct result of the wording in new versions. Documented are the thousands of words, verses, and doctrines by which new versions will prepare the apostate churches of these last days to accept the religion of the Antichrist - even his mark, image, and Lucifer worship. The Greek manuscripts, critical editions, lexicons and dictionaries behind the new versions are examined, revealing their occult origins, contents, and yet unreleased material - a blueprint for the Antichrist's One World Religion and government.\n\nPresented also is the latest research proving the Authorized King James Version represents not only Christianity's earliest and most widely used Greek text, but is the easiest version to read according to computer analysis based formulas from the Flesch-Kincaid research firm. Each page opens a door exposing new version editors - in agreement with Luciferians, occultists, and New Age philosophy - in mental institutions, seance parlors, prison cells, and court rooms for heresy trials - and most shocking of all - denying that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ. Five have lost their ability to speak.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nGail Anne Riplinger (born 1947) is an American writer and speaker known for her support of the inerrancy of the King James Bible.
