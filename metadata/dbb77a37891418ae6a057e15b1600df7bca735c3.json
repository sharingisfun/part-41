Who do you think it could be?\n\nOne thing is certain: there are plenty of surprises in store when My Kitchen Rules launches in 2013.\n\nManu Feildel and Pete Evans return to host and judge the ultimate home-cooking battle as they accept dinner party invites in each state across the country.\n\nThis series they welcome new guest judge Colin Fassnidge to the table alongside returning guest judges Guy Grossi, Karen Martini and Liz Egan.\n\nIt's state versus state, plate against plate, as teams of two attempt to out-dine and out-wine each other to see whose kitchen rules.\n\nEach team will take turns to transform an ordinary home into an instant restaurant for one pressure cooker night. They'll serve up a three course menu designed to impress not only their fellow contestants but our esteemed judges.\n\nThere will be triumphs, kitchen fires, laughter, tears and plenty of opinionated guests as they battle the clock and their nerves to plate up on time.\n\nThe top two teams will again battle it out in the grand final where they will present their ultimate dining menu to a full restaurant.\n\nWith $250,000 in prize money on offer, the knives will definitely be out.\n\nGatecrashers - Food nerds\n\nSwan Valley, WA mates Nastassia and Kieran lead double lives.\n\nBy day, Nastassia , 29, is a super-organised property manager, overseeing a department of six at a real estate agency.\n\nBy night, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unleashing her nerdy obsession: her addiction to 1980s cartoons.\n\nTo the outside world Kieran, 31, in sales at JB Hifi, is metal guy: the long haired aficionado of all things Metallica and heavy metal music.\nBut in his other life heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passionately committed to table top gaming Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kieran has been playing War Hammer since he was 12.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Yes, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a nerd,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Kieran, who plays with NastassiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband.\n\nKieranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend is Aaron, NastassiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband of two years and partner of 11. And now Kieran and Nastassia cook together every other Sunday.\n\nNastassia only learned to cook when she and Aaron moved in together.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Cooking was forced on me because my husband couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fend for himself,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When I first moved out I was quite happy to live on Vegemite sandwiches. Then he moved in with me and I suddenly had to feed him. I admit I was really bad at cooking at first. I was 19. I just got better and started to buy more cookbooks and enjoy it. I started doing my mumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recipes and got excited about it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nKieranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cooking also came out of necessity.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I was really fussy as a kid Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a terrible eater,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mum forced it on me she said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not cooking for you. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sick of cooking different meals for everyone.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ I cooked steak and mushrooms for myself when I was seven. But it took me a while to get into it. I hated the smell of garlic and got to 19 and the switch went on. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d help Mum and it went from there.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAs hard working as Nastassia is, she says her mum passing away last year from diabetes-related heart disease caused her to reassess.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When I lost Mum I realised I needed to change my world. I was working 14-hour days. My husband would ring Ã¢â‚¬Â¨and say Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhere are you?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just recently changedÃ¢â‚¬Â¨ my outlook on things, have become more mellow and not as rigid.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a bit,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ smiles Kieran. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still bossy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb77a37891418ae6a057e15b1600df7bca735c3","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.AU.S04E15.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb77a37891418ae6a057e15b1600df7bca735c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,183,122,55,137,20,24,174,106,5,126,21,177,96,13,247,188,167,53,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
