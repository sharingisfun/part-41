Now they will ramp up properly and eventually, probably, kill you. But hey, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the drama!\n\nSorry about that. Testing storytellers properly is hard because it takes so long and the results are so noisy.\nYour savegames from Alpha 4 will still work.\n\n\nRemember to support the creator of the game if you enjoyed it!\nrimworldgame.com\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3bf487e0ef3b213e5bdabe71b22f3753a2f792b","amp;dn":"RimWorldAlpha4c+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3bf487e0ef3b213e5bdabe71b22f3753a2f792b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,191,72,126,14,243,178,19,229,189,171,231,27,34,243,117,58,47,121,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
