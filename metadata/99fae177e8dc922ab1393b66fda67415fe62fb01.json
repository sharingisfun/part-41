Further modulation is possible using the post-processing effects; an all-pass interpolator chorus and delay unit provide a fuller sound and an over-sampled analogue prototype paragraphic equaliser is provided with dual LFOs. These features make for a livelier, more creative sound than typically associated with some convolution reverbs.\n\nIn addition to loading impulse responses from audio files Reverberate is able to generate supplementary independent early reflections and tails for additional control over a roomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sonic characteristics.\n\n   Dual true-stereo convolution reverb\n   Zero latency (or select up to 8192 samples latency)\n   250 categorised presets (400 MB of IRs)\n   Early reflections and tails modules\n   SplitMod early/late pitch modulation\n   True stereo simulation for stereo IRs\n   Double oversampled EQ with modulation per IR\n   Linear-interpolation choruses for IR1, IR2 and post effects\n   Stereo delays with modulation for IR2, IR2 and post effects\n   Post EQ with LFO modulation\n   Modulation via MIDI-CC\n   Stereo widener with anti-phase reduction\n   ADSHR envelopes with shape control\n   Low CPU downsampling mode option\n   Presence filter for adding synthetic high frequency content to dark IRs\n   Impulse response chaining\n   Neon Blue or Soft Green skin options\n   Integrated preset and sample browsers\n   Drag and drop IRs from OS file browsers\n   Wav, WIR, SDIR, Aiff and Flac file support\n   32/64-bit VST, AU and AAX on Mac and PC\n   Precise parameter entry\n   Recursive lost files search\n\n\n\nfor Intel Mac - Leopard 10.5.8 to Mavericks 10.9.x (VST, AU, RTAS, AAX)\n\n\n\n      [Installation]\n\n     UnRar\n\n[Usage]\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Clean up (see below).\n3.Install the software.\n4.Copy our cracks.\n If you choose AU(ALT), copy our *.vst to /*.component/ instead.\n Default AU is native but AU(ALT) is a VST wrapper.\n5.Enjoy!\n\n[CleanUp]\nIf you have installed previous version, delete the following directory :\n/User/Library/Preferences/LiquidSonics\n\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
