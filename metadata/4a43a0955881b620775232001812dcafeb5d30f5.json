I was also taking a night class in film         |\n    | production where the teacher turned out to be Kiyoshi Kurosawa     |\n    | (the director of CURE and KAIRO, and the executive producer of     |\n    | JU-ON the movie). He gave us the assignment to make a 3 min short  |\n    | from an original script. It turned out that Kurosawa like my film  |\n    | very much,maybe because it was horror and that was to his taste.   |\n    |                                                                    |\n    | Actually, it's never been my intention simply to make horror films.| \n    | I mean, I like horror films, but I had no real ambitions to make   |\n    | them before this assignment.                                       |\n    |                                                                    |\n    | Eventually, Kurosawa introduced me to a producer at Kansai-TV who  |\n    | was producing a 90 min. feature for television. The title was Gakko|\n    | no Kaidan G (School Ghost Story G). G is supposed to mean &quot;Great&quot;. |\n    | Maybe the producer came up with the title to compete with Dragon   |\n    | Ball Z, I don't know (laughs). It was going to be a horror         |\n    | anthology and I was assigned to write and direct.                  |\n    |                                                                    |\n    | But because I had no previous professional directorial experience, |\n    | the producer had no confidence in me. I wrote many scripts for 30  |\n    | minute segments but the producer asked me to direct two and to cut |\n    | them down to 3 minutes. I wondered, how can I scare the audience   |\n    | in so short a time (laughs)? But those two short segments that I   |\n    | made are actually the foundations of JUON. They lay out the basic  |\n    | premise of the curse and it is almost like the true prequel of the |\n    | story.                                                             |\n    |--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    |--------------------------------------------------------------------|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a43a0955881b620775232001812dcafeb5d30f5","amp;dn":"Shimizu+Takashi+-+2+Shorts+from+%5C%27Gakko+no+Kaidan+G%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a43a0955881b620775232001812dcafeb5d30f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,67,160,149,88,129,182,32,119,82,50,0,24,18,220,175,235,93,48,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
