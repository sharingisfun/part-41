Lost\n2. Djarum\n3. Flutter\n\n24:40 min\n320 kbps\n\n&quot;Warning: Lost and Djarum contain repetitive beats. We advise you not to play these tracks if the Criminal Justice Bill becomes law. Flutter has been programmed in such a way that no bars contain identical beats and can therefore be played at both forty five and thirty three revolutions under the proposed new law. However we advise DJs to have a lawyer and a musicologist present at all times to confirm the non-repetative nature of the music in the event of police harrassment. \n\nImportant: By breaking this seal, you accept full responsibilty for any consequential action resulting from the products use, as playing the music contained within these recordings may be interpreted as oppostion to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e2e92127c631b6b9629ae0c5a5de1a08e16817","amp;dn":"Autechre+-+Anti+EP+%5B1994%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e2e92127c631b6b9629ae0c5a5de1a08e16817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,226,233,33,39,198,49,182,185,98,154,224,197,165,222,26,8,225,104,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
