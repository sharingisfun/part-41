The first in a six-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 17. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.\n\nFile is in MP3 format.\n\nSnap Into Seeding![IMG]http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e128/fullbug/machoavatar.png[/IMG][color=Red]OOOOOOH YEAHHHHH!![/color]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b0f0b7d8367aa8a1a539b5a19885eb2e9c834cc","amp;dn":"I+Know+Why+The+Caged+Bird+Sings+-+Maya+Angelou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b0f0b7d8367aa8a1a539b5a19885eb2e9c834cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,15,11,125,131,103,170,138,26,83,155,90,25,136,94,178,233,200,52,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
