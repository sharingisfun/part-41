Run To The Hills\n02. Hallowed Be Thy Name\n03. Phantom Of The Opera\n04. Iron Maiden\n05. Drifter\n\n\nVery good bootleg, soundboard sourced, i think. The set-list is short, only 5 songs. All the tracks were edited, there's a fade-out/fade-in in all songs. Sound is very good but with a little hiss...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6814b87ed25d07dcbe95b5a7bebd25adb527e6b3","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+1982-04-29+-+Stuttgart+%28SOUNDBOARD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6814b87ed25d07dcbe95b5a7bebd25adb527e6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,20,184,126,210,93,7,220,190,149,181,167,190,189,37,173,181,39,230,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
