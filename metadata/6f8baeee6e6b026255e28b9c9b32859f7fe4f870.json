The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ taking their cues from their parents ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f8baeee6e6b026255e28b9c9b32859f7fe4f870","amp;dn":"Naruto+%5BS02%5D+%5BE36-83%5D+%5BEnglish%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f8baeee6e6b026255e28b9c9b32859f7fe4f870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,139,174,238,110,107,2,98,85,226,139,156,155,50,133,159,127,228,248,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
