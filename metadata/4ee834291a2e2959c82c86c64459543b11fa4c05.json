Includes all updates and a new campaign, as well as full cross-platform saves compatibility and an all-new interface designed specifically for touch based platforms.\n\nDoor Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.\n\nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n\nIt may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a skill harder to master.\n\nQuick Points:\n\nÃ‚Â§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator\nÃ‚Â§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.\nÃ‚Â§ Top Down perspective for optimal tactical analysis\nÃ‚Â§ Real Time With Free Pause\nÃ‚Â§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\nÃ‚Â§ Realistic but action packed\nÃ‚Â§ Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- fixed crash at app startup\n- fixed field of view when using hidden camera\n- fixed missing textures in randomly generated killhouses\n- improved device compatibility\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.khg.doorkickers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.khg.doorkickers&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Copy 'com.khg.doorkickers' folder to 'sdcard/Android/obb'\n2.Install APK\n3.Launch the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee834291a2e2959c82c86c64459543b11fa4c05","amp;dn":"Door+Kickers+v1.0.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee834291a2e2959c82c86c64459543b11fa4c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,232,52,41,26,46,41,89,200,44,134,198,68,89,84,59,17,250,76,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
