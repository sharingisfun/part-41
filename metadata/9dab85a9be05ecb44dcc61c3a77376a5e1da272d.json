You never know when one of those conversations will challenge your Christian faith. Are you equipped to effectively deal with this skepticism? Meet The Skeptic teaches believers to think about skepticism in categories. Chasing down answers to every objection a skeptic raises often leads nowhere because the conversation becomes a superficial game of one-upmanship. By uncovering the presuppositions (Root Ideas) behind objections, Meet The Skeptic trains believers how to steer conversations with skeptics in a more meaningful direction rather than trying to win the argument. It will help readers:\n-Get to the Root Ideas of worldviews instead of pulling at the weeds\n-Recognize the Red-Flag Words that prop up objections\n-Scrutinize bumper-sticker comments\n-Ask probing questions and acquire an ear for opportunities\nMeet The Skeptic is effective for conversational training as well as being a model for building an apologetics curriculum. The four categories described provide a framework into which believers can organize and connect worldview ideas.\n\nAbout the author:\nAs a Christian apologist and owner of a brand image and design firm, Bill Foster has a unique perspective of how the popular culture perceives and is influenced by the ideas that shape our world. He has created an approach for engaging skeptics that breaks down objections into categories. Bill believes that understanding the worldviews behind these categories, rather than chasing down answers to every objection, is the key to reaching the heart of a skepticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thinking.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dab85a9be05ecb44dcc61c3a77376a5e1da272d","amp;dn":"Meet+The+Skeptic+-+Bill+Foster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dab85a9be05ecb44dcc61c3a77376a5e1da272d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,171,133,169,190,5,236,180,77,204,97,195,167,115,118,165,225,218,39,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
