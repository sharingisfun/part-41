G. de Vries and C. J. Elsevier (Wiley, 2007).pdf\n\nISBN: 978-3-527-31161-3\n\nThis multi-volume handbook is the first to cover all questions concerning homogeneous hydrogenation. As such, it presents the catalysts, the scope of their application, mechanistic aspects, asymmetric methods, combinatorials catalysis, recycling methods and industrial examples. In 45 clearly structured chapters, the book includes all hydrogenation reactions catalyzed by soluble transition metal-based catalysts. All authors adopt an applied approach, emphasizing those aspects important for industrial use. With some 2,000 illustrations and 50 tables, this is a must-have for everyone working in the chemicals and pharmaceutical industries, as well as for graduate students in chemistry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6944fbbdcdcf996e98702d4a343577a258ef805","amp;dn":"The+Handbook+of+Homogeneous+Hydrogenation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6944fbbdcdcf996e98702d4a343577a258ef805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,148,79,187,220,220,249,150,233,135,2,212,163,67,87,122,37,142,248,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
