He has raised it to an art through the high craft of the Connable Method. Through it, he has managed to transform the ugliness of death into a thing of dignity and beauty. Victims brutalized by war, street fights, tavern brawls, ambushes, fires, every hazard in a raw West---these, in his hands, become presentable. Everywhere on the frontier, which erupts with life and death, he offers his skill: to the rich of San Francisco, the bawds and ruffians of the Barbary Coast, to Kansas cowboys, outlaws, soldiers, and sheriffs. He is devoted to dignifying the dead.\n\nShe is devoted to making her marriage whole, in spite of the tragedy that surrounds it and, most especially, in spite of the tragedy that in one terrible afternoon strikes at its center.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96f9b110bcc36742c18f730ff208b8e3c9ffe14e","amp;dn":"Loren+D.+Estleman-The+Undertaker%27s+Wife","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96f9b110bcc36742c18f730ff208b8e3c9ffe14e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,249,177,16,188,195,103,66,193,143,115,15,242,8,184,227,201,255,225,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
