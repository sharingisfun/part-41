Examples \ninclude the man in the white lab coat in the beginning (that kills the fly that \ncauses the film&amp;#039;s events) isn&amp;#039;t watching an interview with Helpmann, but an \n&quot;Arrest and Detainment&quot; show about Tuttle and Sam&amp;#039;s fellow employees watching \nthe film without music with gunshots left.\n    * The scene at the restaurant starts the film with Shirley offering Sam the \nsalt, and the explosion in the restaurant.\n    * Extended, more romantic dialogue between Sam and Jill is added after \nTuttle switches the sewage and air pipes at Sam&amp;#039;s flat. This is one of many \nscenes between Jill and Sam that was cut out of Gilliam&amp;#039;s cut and re-added for \nthis one.\n    * You do not see the inflamed guard when the police vehicle crashes during \nthe chase.\n    * It is never stated that Buttle is dead, only asked by his wife.\n    * Lots of curse words were replaced with tamer dialogue.\n    * The &quot;Something for an executive&quot; scene is intact, however, afterwards, \nonly Sam is captured while Jill is not killed.\n    * The film ends with a brief sequence where Jill wakes Sam in their country \nhideaway. Sam says &quot;I don&amp;#039;t dream any more&quot;, looks at a picture on the wall of \nhimself wearing the dream-sequence wings, and the film ends with them flying up \ninto the heavens. Jack Lint and Mr. Helpmann do not interrupt the ending of the \nfantasy (thereby altering the ending of the film).\n    * Many of the fantasy sequences are missing, or slightly different, like \nhaving an opaque surrounding the scene.\n    * Extended dialogue between Jill and Sam outside his apartment, and while in \nthe truck is added.\n    * Extended dialogue in the scene where Sam meets Jack at Information \nRetrieval is added as well, and Jack has his daughter in his office.\n    * A cut of Casablanca featuring the line &quot;Here&amp;#039;s looking at you, kid.&quot; right \nafter Sam leaves Kurtzmann&amp;#039;s office.\n    * Jack says &quot;You look like you&amp;#039;ve seen a ghost, Sam...&quot; to Sam at the \nentrance of the Ministry of Records when Sam sees Jill Layton. This scene is \nalso in the American cut.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Personal Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy releases so far... personal rips from original DVDs, looking for quality.\n\nWhenever there&amp;#039;s an AC3 file, there&amp;#039;s 99% possibilities this is the directly\nripped audio track from the DVD, untouched.\n\nThey&amp;#039;re usually uploaded in TPB, Mininova and Demonoid, but feel free to share \nthem on edonkey networks or in any way you want.
