Perhaps best known as the outspoken host of E!'s late night talk show, &quot;Chelsea Lately,&quot; Handler continues to offer international audiences her fearless honesty and tongue-in-cheek commentary every weeknight. &quot;I've decided to go on tour and support my new book, Uganda Be Kidding Me. I think we all know how much I love the sound of my own voice,&quot; said Handler. She'll share some of her favorite stories, discuss her life and career, and touch on the idea of genius in comedy, and will sell and sign copies of her new book afterwards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7488cfd640ce0241c02f424baf3d0de1d118c83b","amp;dn":"Chelsea.Handler.In.Conversation.With.Ronan.Farrow.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7488cfd640ce0241c02f424baf3d0de1d118c83b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,136,207,214,64,206,2,65,192,47,66,75,175,61,13,225,209,24,200,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
