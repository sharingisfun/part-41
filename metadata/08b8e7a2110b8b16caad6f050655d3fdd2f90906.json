Sadly for Chloe's year 11 class it is also the results of their mock exams and the news is not good. Chloe has to deploy every trick in the book to get the class back on track and she starts by telling some hard truths to their mums and dads on parents' evening.\n\nIt is also the time of the year for school trips. Oliver has hatched a plan to inspire his business studies group by taking them to Greenwich University, where he hopes the august surroundings will rub off on them.\n\nCharles decides to take a bunch of his Croydon students on an ambitious five-day trip to a farm in Wiltshire. He hopes that the change of scenery will make a difference to their behaviour in class, particularly that of class clown Walid.\n\nFirst broadcast\nBBC Three, 9:00PM Thu, 30 Jan 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b8e7a2110b8b16caad6f050655d3fdd2f90906","amp;dn":"Tough+young+teachers+s01e04.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b8e7a2110b8b16caad6f050655d3fdd2f90906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,184,231,162,17,11,139,22,202,173,111,5,6,85,211,253,210,249,9,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
