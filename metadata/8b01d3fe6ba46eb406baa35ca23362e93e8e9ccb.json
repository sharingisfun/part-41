Its only because tversity is a streaming program and its files access the internet and network so most anti-virus's pick it up as a virus.\n\n\nNO VIRUS FILES ARE IN THE TORRENT\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\nVersion 1.9.3 (November 24, 2010)\n\nPro edition\nExpand and refresh list of supported premium content sites.\nAccept any HTML page and not just supported sites, showing the full page at 800ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€600 in such cases (this is instead of zooming in on the video player box).\nFaster playback start for premium content (and any content requiring the server side browser).\nFix BBC iPlayer issues - it is now fully supported (including age verification).\nImprove audio/video synchronization of server side browser.\nXML metafiles that had an HTML mime type were not treated as metafiles but rather rendered via the server side browser - this is now fixed.\nFlash player plugin now bundled with installation wizard - no need to do a separate install.\nAll editions\nNew browser toolbar that includes a menu of supported web content sites (facilitates content discovery) and a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsubscribeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ button (enables 1-click addition of web content to the media library).\nMonitor folders for changes and automatically reflect these changes in the media library.\nSupport more than one TVersity instance on the network with the Xbox 360 - this is thanks to the fact that each instance now generates its UDN.\nMonitor changes to network interfaces on the computer and handle those changes correctly.\nProperly handle power management events (sleep, hibernate, resume) and shutdown in terms of SSDP.\nUp to 7x faster indexation of photos.\nService starts correctly when user name (and hence installation path) includes non English characters.\nCorrupt AVI files can no longer cause the indexation process to spend many minutes on one file - we timeout after 5 seconds per file and skip it.\nSoftware was mistakenly transcoding mp3 above 128kbps when used with the iPhone - this is no longer the case.\nAlbum art is now supported for WMA and not just MP3.\nDeliver higher resolution album art when available.\nPlaylists were not indexed by folder until the second time the library was refreshed - this is now fixed.\nSimplify and improve the installation wizard:\nEliminate the configuration wizard (its functionality was merged into the installation wizard).\nMake sure the user has admin rights.\nRemove firewall rules when uninstalling.\nWarn users when skipping installation of ffdshow or when unchecking the firewall checkbox.\nWhen installing for the first time, the service was always set to automatic start, even when the relevant checkbox was unchecked - this is now fixed.\nFix some rare crashes as well as many additional minor bugs.\n\n\nSupported Premium Content Sites\nThe Pro edition of TVersity letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s you subscribe to an ever growing collection of premium online content websites and watch your favorite programming on TV via your game console, Set-Top-Box and many other devices.\n\nHulu\nBBC iPlayer\nJoost\nCBS\nNBC\nThe WB\nTV.com\nESPN\nNFL\nMTV\nVH1\nSling.com\nIMDB.com\nThe Daily Show\nThe Colbert Report\nComedy Central\nSouth Park\nMarvel\nThe Discovery Channel\nNational Geographic Channel\nE Online\nCNN\nSnag Films\nYouTube Movies and Full Episodes\nMy Damn Channel\nNotes\nSome of these websites are only available in certain regions of the world.\nThe above list is subject to change without prior notice.\nSupported by All Product Editions\n* Audio and Video Podcasts (see iTunes for a comprehensive list of podcasts available online).\n* WMA and WMV streaming (RTSP, MMS, HTTP).\n* Any common audio/photo/video format available over HTTP.\n* Subscription to RSS/MRSS/ATOM/OPML/RDF.\n* YouTube (except most movies and full episodes which require the Pro version)\n* Google Video\n* Flickr\n* Funny Or Die\n* Flix.co.il\nKnown to work via 3rd party tools\n* last.fm via the last.fm proxy\n* Sirius and XM Satellite Radio via SiriusXMStreamer\n\n\n\nSupported Devices\nTVersity supports three families of devices and applications:\n\nUPnP / DLNA Devices - Devices supporting the UPnP AV / DLNA standard (which is the de-facto standard for connecitivity between devices in the digital home). This includes devices like networked TVs, DVDs, Stereo Receivers, Digital Media Adapters/Receivers, Mobile Phones, Satellite and Cable set-top-boxes and more.\n\nWeb enabled Devices - Devices with a web browser (XHTML-MP or WAP 2.0) and media streaming or downloading capabilities like Mobile Phones, PDAs, the Sony PSP, and more.\n\nRSS / Podcasts enabled Devices - Devices with an RSS reader that can handle enclosed media and either stream or download it, like the Sony PSP, iTunes/iPod and more.\n\nAdobe Flash enabled Devices - Devices with Adboe Flash 7 or higher like the Sony Playstation 3 and the Nintendo Wii.\n\nWindows Media Center hosted HTML - Devices and computers supporting Microsoft Windows Media Center hosted HTML or other compatible software, such as Active-TV enabled PCs and the Active-TV compliant variant of the DLink DSM 520.\n\nUPnP / DLNA Devices\nThe TVersity Media Server supports (among other things) the UPNP AV standard and therefore in theory should work with any UPNP AV or DLNA compliant media hub such as the ones from DLink, Linksys, Netgear, SMC, Philips, Gateway, Sony, Roku, Govideo etc. However one of the unique qualities of the TVersity Media Server is that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s designed to automatically do all the necessary conversions to allow successful and optimal playback of virtually any media content on any of its supported media hubs. Therefore only officially supported media hubs can take advantage of the full range of benefits the TVersity Media Server can offer. Furthermore some of those devices can be automatically detected by the TVersity Media Server, while others require the user to manually set the server to assume it is serving a specific type of device.\n\nDevices that can automatically be identified by TVersity and have been tested to work:\n\nThe Sony Playstation 3\nThe Xbox 360\nThe DirecTV HR20/HR22 (only in Version 1.8 or older)\nThe Sony Vaio VGP-MR100U\nThe DLink DSM 320/320R/320RD\nThe DLink DSM 510/520 (firmware 1.02 or higher, older firmware versions are identified as DSM 320)\nThe Philips Streamium SL300i/SL400i/MX6000i\nThe Roku Soundbridge M500/M1000/M2000\nThe Philips SLA5500/5520\nThe Omnifi DMS1\nThe Nokia 770 or N800/810 Internet Tablet via Media Streamer add-on from Nokia\nLobsterTunes\nDevices that have been tested and confirmed to work but cannot be automatically identified and hence require explicit setting via the TVersity GUI:\n\nThe Netgear MP101\nTerratec Noxon (never tested by TVersity but reported by some users to work well)\nThe SMC EZStream SMCWMR-AG (this device has some unique limitations, please read further in the FAQ to learn more)\n\nThe Gateway ADC220/320 (this device has some unique limitations, please read further in the FAQ to learn more)\n\nThe GoVideo D2730/D2740 (never tested by TVersity but reported by some users to work well due to the hardware resemblence to the Gateway ADC 220/320)\n\nDevices and software that were never tested by us but were reported by users to work:\n\nThe Zensonic Z400\nSiemens M740AV DVB-T receiver\nPinnacle Showcenter 200\nTelegent TG100\nSnazio Net DVD Cinema SZ1300\nAcer AT3705-MGW LCD TV and Acer MG3001-p\nThe Nokia N80 phone\nGeeXboX\nXbox Media Center\nPioneer BDP-95FD BLU-RAY player\nLinksys WMLS11B\nTechnika Smartbox 8320HD\nNote:\nThese devices typically have no settings in the TVversity GUI since there is no device profile for them. This means that transcoding wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work for them out of the box, however advanced users are welcome to create device profiles (these are just XML configurations) and send them to us for inclusion. In fact, some of the devices above already have user contributed profiles and for them you will be able to transcode either out of the box, or after explicitly selecting them in the TVersity GUI.\n\nWeb enabled Devices\nThe TVersity Media Server allows any device with a web browser to access the media library and download or stream the multimedia content of the library. Whether media is downloaded or streamed is device dependent, for example the web browser running on your desktop may do either of these things depending on its configuration. The web browser on the Sony PSP is configured to download content to the memory card. Web browsers on mobile phones typically do one of those things depending on the make and model, or they may refuse to access multimedia content from the web browser completely for reasons typically related to business decisions made by wireless carriers to maximize their financial gain from your media consumption habits (the next time you switch carriers you may want to check their policy with regard to this matter).\n\nThe devices that are currently supported are:\n\nApple iPhone / iPad / iPod Touch\nBlackberry phones (OS 4 or higher)\nThe Sony PSP (firmware 2.6 or higher) via its built-in web browser\nThe Nokia 770 or N800/810 Internet Tablets via its built-in web browser and media player\nThe Sony Playstation 3\nThe Nintendo Wii\nComputers and laptops on any operating system that has either Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Opera\nRSS / Podcasts enabled Devices\n\nThe TVersity Media Server allows any device with an RSS Reader to access the media library and download or stream the multimedia content of the library. Whether media is downloaded or streamed is device dependent.\nFor example iTunes typically downloads the media enclosed in RSS feeds so that it can be converted to an iPod friendly format (if necessary) and syncrhonized with the iPod. In contrast, the Sony PSP, being a connected devices and not a hard-drive based device, streams the media enclosed in RSS feeds off the network without storing it locally.\n\nThe devices that are currently supported are:\n\nThe Sony PSP (firmware 2.6 or higher) via its built-in RSS reader.\nThe Apple iPod via iTunes\nThe Juice Podcast Receiver (formerly iPodder)\nAdobe Flash enabled Devices\nThe TVersity Media Server allows any device with Adobe Flash 7 or higher to access the media library and stream the multimedia content of the library. Streaming is done by converting the media on the fly to MP3 for Audio, Flash Video for video and JPEG for images.\n\nThe devices that are currently supported are:\n\nThe Sony Playstation 3\nThe Nintendo Wii\nRemote computers of any operating system that has Adobe Flash 7 or higher","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b01d3fe6ba46eb406baa35ca23362e93e8e9ccb","amp;dn":"TVersity+1.9.3+Pro+PORTABLE+TvErSiTy_SuPpOrT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b01d3fe6ba46eb406baa35ca23362e93e8e9ccb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,1,211,254,107,164,110,180,6,186,163,92,162,51,98,233,62,142,156,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
