When dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health fails, the siblings are then more concerned with the money he might leave them.\n\nThe story weaves in and out of reality and hallucination and possibly back in forth in time, and to complicate things further, the sister is sexually obsessed with a mysterious man throughout the tale Ã¢â‚¬â€ or is it her brother (at one point posing as his sister so that he might gain his and her inheritance) that is so hot and bothered by this mystery stud? And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only the tip of the iceberg. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a venture into ghost territory, with frauds bilking the gullible and FritzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character(s) right in the middle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0717137697d676b75215fabce8397c3d05744a7","amp;dn":"Gilbert+Hernandez+-+Love+From+The+Shadows+%28GN%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0717137697d676b75215fabce8397c3d05744a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,113,113,55,105,125,103,107,117,33,95,171,206,131,151,195,208,87,68,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
