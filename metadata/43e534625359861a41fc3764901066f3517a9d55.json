In this study, Chuck Missler explores the background and historical questions concerning the birth of the Messiah.\n\nArticles\n\nThe Feast of Stephen\n\nJohn Loeffler takes an in-depth look at how the traditions and religious observances surrounding Christmas (Christ's Mass) came into being.\n\nThe Scepter of Judah\n\nChuck Missler examines many of the prophetic events in the Old Testament heralding the coming of a Savior.\n\nWhy a Virgin Birth?\n\nChuck Missler examines the Biblical roots and reasons behind the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ. Was this event foretold in the Old Testament (the Torah)?\n\nWho Were the Magi?\n\nChuck Missler discusses the identity and Medo-Persian history of the Magi - whose gifts of gold, frankincence, and myrrh announced Jesus as King of the Jews, according to the messianic prophecies of Daniel.\n\nThe Origins of our Christmas Traditions\n\nIt is disturbing to discover that much of what we have been taught about the Christmas season seems to be more tradition than truth.\n\nWhat really happened in Bethlehem two thousand years ago?\nWho were the &quot;Magi?&quot;\nWhy a virgin birth?\nWhat does a Christmas Tree have to do with it?\nEach year at Christmas we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\nAfter the New Year, we struggle to remember to add a year as we date our checks, which should remind us that the entire Western World reckons its calendar from the birth of the One who changed the world more than any other before or since.\n\nIt is disturbing to discover that much of what we have been taught about the Christmas season seems to be more tradition than truth. Santa Claus isn't the only myth or legend that has arisen out of this season.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
