One of Kafka's best-known works, it tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor the reader.\n\nLike Kafka's other novels, The Trial was never completed, although it does include a chapter which brings the story to an end. Because of this there are certain inconsistencies which exist within the novel, such as disparities in timing in addition to other flaws in narration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c76c0e7aff45c5d451389c3582f6025a591c9a4","amp;dn":"The+Trial+by+Frack+Kafka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c76c0e7aff45c5d451389c3582f6025a591c9a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,118,192,231,175,244,92,93,69,19,137,195,88,47,96,37,165,145,201,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
