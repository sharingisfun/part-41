The novel is an adaptation of the first four parts of Adams' radio series of the same name. The novel was first published in London on 12 October 1979. It sold 250,000 copies in the first three months.\n\nThe namesake of the novel is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a fictional guide book for hitchhikers (inspired by the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe) written in the form of an encyclopedia.\n\n===============================================================================\n\nI put this together because I am a huge fan of Douglas Adams and the Hitchhikers &quot;trilogy&quot; but I could never find a propper rip of these audiobooks. Sure, there's plenty of rips in shitty, lossy mp3, but who the fuck wants that? FLAC gives you full loseless audio, and when you have audio books which are narrated by Stephen Fry and Martin Freeman, why would you want anything else?\nSo I bought all 5 audiobooks on cd, ripped each disc using Exact Audio Copy, logs and scans are included. Enjoy!\n\nAll I ask in return is that you #KeepSeeding! \n\n==========================================================================\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened.
