They \\'re to play in Paris at Charles\\'s school reunion. In getting to Paris and back, the characters interact with Aimee\\'s ex-husband and her abrasive, cruel ex-mentor, Louise\\'s would-be lover who turns out to have a husband, Mickey\\'s long-time lover and her children, Bertrand\\'s Germanic wife and their children who speak no French, and Frederic\\'s distant mother. The band also meets Clara, a mercurial free spirit who beguiles Bertrand, then Mickey, then takes up with someone else in the band.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf13d1abcdea33e13bdf3049e68aad73246f665","amp;dn":"Jacques+Monnet+-+Clara+et+les+Chics+Types+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf13d1abcdea33e13bdf3049e68aad73246f665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,241,61,26,188,222,163,62,19,189,243,4,158,104,170,215,50,70,246,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
