It publishes top 30 lists sent by stations which subscribe at a cost of a few hundred dollars a year. It is also sent to record companies and their public relations and publicity representatives as well as record stores. CMJ also formerly published CMJ New Music Monthly, which was a magazine with interviews, reviews, and special features. Each magazine came with an indie buzz band's cassette or a mix CD of 15-24 songs by well-established bands, unsigned bands and everything in between. The staff puts together CMJ Music Marathon, a convention and music festival, each autumn, in New York.
