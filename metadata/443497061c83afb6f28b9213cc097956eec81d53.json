Drawing on a decade of experience battling for freedom of speech on campus, First Amendment lawyer Greg Lukianoff reveals how higher education fails to teach students to become critical thinkers: by stifling open debate, our campuses are supercharging ideological divisions, promoting groupthink, and encouraging an unscholarly certainty about complex issues.\n\nLukianoff walks readers through the life of a modern-day college student, from orientation to the end of freshman year. Through this lens, he describes startling violations of free speech rights: a student in Indiana punished for publicly reading a book, a student in Georgia expelled for a pro-environment collage he posted on Facebook, students at Yale banned from putting an F. Scott Fitzgerald quote on a T shirt, and students across the country corralled into tiny Ã¢â‚¬Å“free speech zonesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when they wanted to express their views.\n\nBut Lukianoff goes further, demonstrating how this culture of censorship is bleeding into the larger society. As he explores public controversies involving Juan Williams, Rush Limbaugh, Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins, Larry SummersÃ¢â‚¬â€even Dave Barry and Jon StewartÃ¢â‚¬â€Lukianoff paints a stark picture of our ability as a nation to discuss important issues rationally. Unlearning Liberty: Campus Censorship and the End of American Debate illuminates how intolerance for dissent and debate on todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campus threatens the freedom of every citizen and makes us all just a little bit dumber.\n\n336 pages\nPublisher: Encounter Books (October 23, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1594036357\nISBN-13: 978-1594036354","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:443497061c83afb6f28b9213cc097956eec81d53","amp;dn":"Unlearning+Liberty+%282014%29+by+Greg+Lukianoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"443497061c83afb6f28b9213cc097956eec81d53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,52,151,6,28,131,175,182,242,139,146,19,204,9,121,86,238,200,29,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
