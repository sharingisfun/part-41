Originally from the UK, Paul Simmans is a guitar alchemist, creating vast aural landscapes ripe with ghostlike string sections and undertones of sinister depth as well as transcendent bliss. Mia d'Bruzzi has been a notorious player in the San Francisco underground music scene since the early '80s. Co-founder of seminal all-female punk band Frightwig (Subterranean Records, Southern Records), Mia has also toured and recorded with legendary SF darlings The Mudwimin (Big Dog, Broken Rekids), as well as pop punk sensations Fabulous Disaster (Black&amp;Pink). Paul and Mia met in the UK in 1999 and have been collaborating ever since. The GONE TO GROUND EP formally debuts their shared musical mania and is a precursor to their upcoming LP, due to release in spring 2013.\n\n* = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * =\n\nGone to Ground - GONE TO GROUND\nCopyright 2012 Ptchoo Productions, All Rights Reserved\n\nGone to Ground is:\nMia d'Bruzzi - Vocals\nPaul Simmans - Instruments\n\nWritten and performed by Gone to Ground\nAll tracks written and produced by Paul Simmans\nAll lyrics written by Mia d'Bruzzi\nRecorded at Henry Street Studios, San Francisco\nMixed by Paul Simmans\nMastered by Michael Romanowski\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gonetogroundband.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gonetogroundband.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTRACK LIST:\n1.
