This woman has a incredible voice!! Its a shame more people dont know about her. Songs range from every type of mood to incredibly soulful to shake you bootie around the house, to even one gospel song that even got me singing along to it! ..the rock upbeat &quot;Nursery Rhyme&quot; song is a COOL little hip song that kids will love. Ding Dong Daddy one of my personal favorites from this CD, one of my all time Favorite CD&amp;#039;s. If you are into great 50s soulful rock,R&amp;B,or Swing.This 24-track set covers Carr&amp;#039;s R&amp;B tunes, with many unissued but fine tunes such as &quot;If These Walls Could Speak,&quot; &quot;Finders Keepers,&quot; and &quot;Weather Man&quot; finally getting out of the vault. The CD also includes her trademark upbeat, sassy songs, &quot;Jump Jack Jump,&quot; &quot;Boppity Bop (Boogity Boop),&quot; &quot;Ding Dong Daddy&quot; and &quot;Nursery Rhyme Rock.&quot; Thematic variety wasn&amp;#039;t her label&amp;#039;s strong suit when it came to material, and they might have done better with more numbers like &quot;Please Mr. Jailer&quot; and &quot;It&amp;#039;s Raining Outside&quot; and a few less boogies and jump pieces.\n\n1.
