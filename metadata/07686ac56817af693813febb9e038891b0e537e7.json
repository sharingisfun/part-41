Woman\nThe Doors set to reclaim their status as a premier act with L.A. Woman in 1971. The session included guitar work by Marc Benno, and bass by Jerry Scheff. The album contained two Top 20 hits and went on to be their second best-selling studio album, surpassed in sales only by their debut. The album explored their R&amp;B roots, although during rehearsals they had a falling-out with Rothchild. Denouncing &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; as 'cocktail jazz', he quit and handed the production to Botnick. The singles &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;, and &quot;Riders On The Storm&quot; remain mainstays of rock radio programming, and the latter, as of November 25, 2009, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its special significance to recorded music. In the song &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; Jim Morrison scrambles the letters of his own name to chant &quot;Mr. Mojo Risin&quot;. During the sessions, a short clip of the band performing &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot; was filmed. So far as known, this is the last clip of the Doors performing with Morrison. On March 13, 1971, following the recording of L.A. Woman, Morrison took a leave of absence from the Doors and moved to Paris with Pamela Courson. He had visited the city the previous summer and was interested in moving there to become a writer in exile.\nWhile in Paris, he was again drinking heavily and using other drugs. On June 16, the last known recording of Morrison was made when he befriended two street musicians at a bar and invited them to a studio. This recording was finally released in 1994 on a bootleg CD entitled The Lost Paris Tapes.
