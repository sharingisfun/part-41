She is in love with a priest, and the diagnosis of her husbandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mental illness leaves no hope. The psychotherapist, in her attempts to resolve the amassed difficulties, seemingly begins to duplicate the life stages and behavioral patterns of her patient. A script for this film is based on motifs from the best-seller, scandalous novel, Witch and Rain, by female author, Jurga Ivanauskaite. By choosing a priest as the main role for a love story, the author broke an existing societal taboo. Faith, Love and Hope form the trilogy by the authors of this screenplay. Love stands as the grandest of the three.\n\nWhisper.Of.Sin.2007.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-Ltu\nRELEASE.DATE: 2012.01.09: AiR/DVD.DATE: 2007.03.02 (Lithuania):\nRUNTiME: 100 minutes:\nGENRE: Drama:\nLANGUAGE: Lithuanian:\nSUBTiTLES: English:\nViDEO: 841kbps 640x352 1.81 25fps:\n\nAUDiO: 128kbps 48.0kHz MP3:\nSOURCE: PAL DVD9 16:9 Retail R2:\nSiZE: 700MB 37x20MB:\nURL: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929806/\nRATiNG: 7.0/10 - 456 votes:\nNOTES: Thanks goes to TeGijA for the source: Previous rel has bad bad crop.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c457a5971c507ec03a87fcacbbd623cb2e4d89ce","amp;dn":"Whisper.Of.Sin.2007.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-Ltu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c457a5971c507ec03a87fcacbbd623cb2e4d89ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,87,165,151,28,80,126,192,58,135,252,172,187,214,35,203,46,77,137,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
