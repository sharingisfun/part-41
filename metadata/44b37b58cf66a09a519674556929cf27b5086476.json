The screenplay was by Shavelson and by Danny Arnold, who also worked on the 1969 series. Arnold is best known for his later television series, Barney Miller.

He detests dogs and children. He is flustered by women's priorities and avoids commitment, much preferring transient physical relationships. At the office of his eye surgeon, Peter meets a leggy, eye-catching brunette named Terri Kozlenko (Barbara Harris). He likes her very much, but discovers later that she is a single mother to three children.\n\nNevertheless, they develop a close friendship that grows into romance, when Peter realizes that Terri is the only woman who can tolerate his strong anti-feminist opinions. When she rejects his plan of a sexual relationship conducted exclusively at his bachelor pad (so that he doesn't have to bond with her demanding family), he reluctantly proposes to her. They get married and he moves into her apartment, but her rogue ex-husband Stephen (Jason Robards) appears to spend more time with their children. Stephen and Peter clash at first, but they soon become good drinking friends, much to Terri's disapproval.\n\nPeter's eyesight gradually worsens and his boss, Howard Mann (Herb Edelman), begins to criticize his work. Peter schedules a risky operation that could cure his problem, and tries to keep it a secret from Terri to avoid worrying her. Howard gets hysterical and inadvertently ruins Peter's alibi of working away from home on a book. Terri tells him that she had known that Peter was going blind when she first met him.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 736 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.739:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 110 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b37b58cf66a09a519674556929cf27b5086476","amp;dn":"The+War+Between+Men+and+Women+%281972%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Jack+Lemmon%2C+Bar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b37b58cf66a09a519674556929cf27b5086476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,179,123,88,207,102,160,154,81,150,116,85,105,41,207,39,181,8,100,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
