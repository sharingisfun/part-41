These robbers never leave their Charlestown life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include friends Doug MacRay, James Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan and Desmond Elden. Doug and James in particular treat each other like family, as the Coughlins have realistically been as such to Doug since Doug's mother ran off and Doug's father, Stephen MacRay, was sent to prison. James' single mother sister, the drugged out Krista Coughlin, and Doug have a casual sexual relationship. The foursome carry out a mostly successful bank robbery, but due to circumstances take the bank manager, Claire Keesey, hostage for a short period before releasing her physically unharmed. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown... \n\nStarring: Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall and Jon Hamm\n\nDirector: Ben Affleck\n\n\nSCREENSHOT SLIDESHOW\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img87.imageshack.us/slideshow/webplayer.php?id=towndvd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img87.imageshack.us/slideshow/webplayer.php?id=towndvd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d6f14ff01cded76b9e865cb9cc7ba7745c2217","amp;dn":"The+Town+%7B2010%7D+Extended+720p+BRRip+x264+-+HDMiCRO+by+Mr.+KickAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d6f14ff01cded76b9e865cb9cc7ba7745c2217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,214,241,79,240,28,222,215,107,158,134,92,185,204,123,167,116,92,34,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
