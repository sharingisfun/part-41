This book describes five methods which reduce the space that classifiers occupy within TCAMs; TCAM Razor, All-Match Redundancy Removal, Bit Weaving, Sequential Decomposition, and Topological Transformations. These methods demonstrate that in most cases a substantial reduction of space is achieved. Case studies and examples are provided throughout this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:565d38e01263830149b9773bac68f772e53a1744","amp;dn":"Hardware+Based+Packet+Classification+for+High+Speed+Internet+Rou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"565d38e01263830149b9773bac68f772e53a1744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,93,56,224,18,99,131,1,73,185,119,59,172,104,247,114,229,58,23,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
