Filled with plenty of male nudity and an overwhelming essence of homoeroticism, El Mar is a difficult journey that might pay off handsomely for you guys who can stick out the bloody and difficult themes.\n\nAs children during the Spanish Civil War, Andreu Ramallo, Manuel Tur and their friend Francisca live in a world of political assassinations and suspicion between neighbors. When the father of one child is found to be involved with the assassination of another the lives of these three children are changed forever. Ramallo murders one of the children with his own hands and throws a rock at Francisca's head. The tragedy marks the children, who silently carry the secret into their adulthood.\n\nYears later, the three meet again as young adults at a tubercular sanatorium. Ramallo and Manuel have both been admitted as patients and Francisca is a nun in the hospital. Having so far averted the worst ravages of this epidemic, Ramallo and Manuel face other torments in their close quarters. Ramallo, who has spent many of his growing years as a a prostitute and assistant to a middle-aged drug runner, chafes under the attentions of the callous older man. Now that he is in the hospital, he seeks release from this exploitative relationship. Sensitive Manuel has sought solace from past and present horrors in an intense, religious devotion with which he attempts to repress his homosexuality and his desires for his old friend, Ramallo. Only Francisca the nun knows the darkest secrets her friends harbor, and she tells no one save God.\n\nDirector Agustin Villaronga authentically invests this strange, beautiful story with an edgy intensity. Featuring excellent performances, and superbly atmospheric cinematography, the film compellingly evokes a time and place\n- source :\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/8646/mar1ct3.jpg &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img97.imageshack.us/img97/1221/mar4yr4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img97.imageshack.us/img97/1221/mar4yr4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource\tdvdrip\nRip Specs\tRIP specs :\nfile size : 928,5 Mb (973 587 887b)\nrun time : 108 mins\n\nVideo :\nCodec : Xvid\nframerate : 23,97 fps\nVideo size : 560 x 304\nBitrate : 998,8 kbps\nAspect ratio : 1,85\n\nAudio :\ncodec : a52\nsample rate : 48 Khz\nbitrate : 192 kbps\nchannel : stereo\n\nThere was a similar upload of this movie by someone else  recently it was 25 fps DX50 and it had problems working in some players and software\nTested plays in VLC, Nero Showtime, works in ConvertXtoDVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:994c81d746b5031fc262a682584e1fb54485080d","amp;dn":"El+mar+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"994c81d746b5031fc262a682584e1fb54485080d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,76,129,215,70,181,3,31,194,98,166,130,88,78,31,181,68,133,8,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
