The reality is some of them were not forgotten and some were not even legends.\n \nNow let me introduce Arsenio Rodriguez. This album features his compositions. He was a genius, a prolific composer and a great innovator. He introduced conga drums, piano and brass section to Cuban septetos making a de-facto revolution in Cuban music. He was also the true creator of mambo. By 1950 when he moved to the US he was already a legend. He kept performing and recording with limited commercial success. He was a cult figure and died poor and forgotten in Los Angeles in 1970. That makes this album a tribute to a true forgotten legend.\n\nSo I'm glad Guajiro Mirabal and BVSC had a shot at Arsenio. This recording is explosive and cheerful. Highly enjoyable dance music that has standed the test of time reaffirming once again Arsenio's position in the history of Cuban music.\n\nOne final thought. The rights to most of the music here, made before Arsenio left to the US, belong to an American company. This is like Melodya, a Russian record company, holding the rights to Leadbelly's songs. Sad, if not disgusting.\n\nPlease pirate this album. Show no mercy on Peer International Corp, USA. They are a bunch of pig bastards.\n\nMay the lord, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, bless this release.\nRamen!\n\nTracks\n1- El Rincon Caliente\n2- Para Bailar el Montuno\n3- Deuda\n4- El Reloj De Pastora\n5- Me Bote de Guano\n6- Mi Corazon No Tiene Quien Lo Llore\n7- Tengo Que Olvidarte\n8- Canta Montero\n9- Chicharronero\n10- Medley- No Vuelvo a Moron - Las Tres Marias - Apurrunenme Mujeres\n11- Dombe Dombe\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan) included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9678fa3755730593201c730988bcd8f9f9503db2","amp;dn":"Buena+Vista+Social+Club+Manuel+Guajiro+Mirabal+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9678fa3755730593201c730988bcd8f9f9503db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,120,250,55,85,115,5,147,32,28,115,9,136,188,216,249,249,80,61,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
