Among the more accessible of the latter category is Katharina VolkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s introduction to OvidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Volk, a professor of classics at Columbia and the new editor of The Transactions of the American Philological Association,is about as high a star in the American academic firmament as one might find. Her tone is devoid of the jargon and pretense by which many an Ovidian monograph is marred. After concise initial chapters on the poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work and life, we find sensible discussions on elegy, women, and Rome, as well as a selective survey of OvidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subsequent reception in Western art and literature.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Sewanee Review, 2012)\n\n&quot; ...the book is truly first-class. It will, I believe, become invaluable for any course in which Ovid is a central component...&quot; (BMCR, 6 February 2012)\n\n&quot;Katharina Volk's Ovid is a wonderfully deft and spirited introduction to the whole of the poet's oeuvre, covering a remarkable amount of ground in just under 150 pages .&quot; (Times Literary Supplement, 16 September 2011)\n\n&quot;That quibble aside, this is an admirable book, suitable as both an up-to-date introduction for tyros and as a refreshing overview of matters Ovidian for advanced scholars.&quot; (Acta Classica,1 December 2011)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Katharina VolkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s splendid new introduction to the poetry of Ovid is at once innovative, expert and highly accessible, bringing triumphantly to life the most entertaining poet of the Romans.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Stephen Harrison, University of Oxford\n\n&quot;Volk's vivid and concise analysis is a tour de force, doing full justice to Ovid's extraordinary artistry and matching the rainbow diversity of his many genres&quot;\nElaine Fantham, Princeton University\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Back Cover\nThe last 25 years have seen a dramatic revival in the popularity of Ovid, making him one of the most popular and widely studied ancient authors. This book provides a concise and accessible introduction to the complete works of the Latin poet, famous for his risquÃƒÂ© love poetry, riveting mythological epic Metamorphoses, and mysterious exile at the orders of the emperor Augustus.\nUsing a thematic approach, Volk lays out what we know about Ovid's life, presents the author's works within their poetic genres, and discusses central Ovidian themes, including art, women, myth, and Augustan Rome. Volk concludes with a study of Ovid's reception over the past 2,000 years.\nThis text reflects the very latest insights of Ovidian scholarship, and will be an indispensable companion to those approaching Ovid for the first time, as well as to more seasoned readers and critics.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nKatharina Volk is Associate Professor of Classics at Columbia University.
