A veritable melting pot of genres and styles (just like NYC), Now You Know leaves nothing on the table and will appeal to just about everyone. Now You Know is a 14 track release and spans genres from ballad to Hard Rock to Alternative to Dance and Pop, but no matter the style all the tunes share Hard Rock roots and a strong sense of melody. Mayhemâ€™s range is not extreme, but she delivers crisp, clear, and passionate vocals across all the tracks whether at the top or bottom end. She gets gritty when she needs to, \r\nBilly Sheehan (Mr. Big, Winery Dogs), who produced and played on the album, Ray Luzier (KoRn, KXM), Ron â€œBumblefootâ€ Thal (Guns Nâ€™ Roses), Russ Parrish (â€œSatchelâ€ from Steel Panther), and Corey Lowery (Saint Asonia, Stuck Mojo). With hard rock roots and melodies that show off her vocal range, Mayhem is excited to bring these new, unreleased songs to the masses this fall.\r\n\r\nStyle: Alternative/Hard Rock\r\n\r\nCountry: USA\r\n\r\nAudio Information: 139 mb | Mp3, CBR 320 kbps\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
