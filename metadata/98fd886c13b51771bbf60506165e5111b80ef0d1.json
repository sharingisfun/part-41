In doing so he lost his one true love, the princess Dejah Thoris, but there's no time to mope--renegade priests of Issus have activated a doomsday device that will destroy Mars's fragile atmosphere, unless Carter can figure out a way to shut it down. He and his son, Carthoris, have no choice but to turn to the people they most despise, the Holy Therns. Carthoris catches the eye of a beautiful thern princess, but what will his father think?\n\nWarlord of Mars #20\nIssus is dead, but her high priest has activated a doomsday device that will destroy Mars's fragile atmosphere. Before they can shut it down, John Carter and his son Carthoris have to figure out where it is! Helping them is Linea, a beautiful black Martian princess with a very special heritage. Linea and Carthoris start to click, and a union between the black and red races could be just what the wounded planet needs. But unknown horrors await the young lovers at the end of their quest.\n\nWarlord of Mars #21\nJohn Carter is just coming to grips with the loss of his princess, Dejah Thoris, when he catches wind of a diabolical plan - Matai Shang, Father of the Therns, knows how to free Dejah from her prison. But Shang is Carter's greatest enemy, and he's not about to hand her over! Mars's greatest hero is in for the wildest ride of his career, and it all starts in Warlord of Mars #21 - The Temple of the Sun!\n\nWarlord of Mars #22\nJohn Carter smashed the power of the therns, the evil priests who enslaved Mars for thousands of years with their false religion. But Matai Shang, the Holy Father of their order, has found the perfect way to strike back--Dejah Thoris. Shang has kidnapped Carter's princess and is heading for a remote kingdom that still blindly clings to his discredited faith. Unfortunately for him, John Carter is hot on his trail!\n\nThanks goes to FullBeard for this release.\n\nWarlord of Mars TPB Volumes 1-2 (Issues #1-18): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8846530&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8846530&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWarlord of Mars #23-27: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8839675&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8839675&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
