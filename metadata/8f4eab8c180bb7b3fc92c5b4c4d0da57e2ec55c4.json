I can't say I complained. We had gotten high up to our eyeballs that night. Everything was going as planned up until it happened...the thing we vowed never to talk about.\n\nNo one anticipated how the world was going to change. I can't remember all the events leading up to it and in some ways, that's not important. But the fact remains. I know far more than I should, and I can't tell anyone. Either way, it wouldn't matter. Fire or ice? It seems the only one who can save us has chosen fire. \n\nI just don't have the heart to tell my friends, but I know the truth. I know we're all going to die out here, and there's no stopping it...&quot;\n\n----------------------\n\nTHIS TORRENT INCLUDES: \n\n- The Chronicles of Burntown, Pt. 2 (Kindle, ePub, PDF formats)\n\n- Kelsey's Theme composed by Peter von Harten\n\n- The Chronicles of Burntown book trailer (avi)\n\n---------------------- \n\nFROM THE AUTHOR: \n\nHello!
