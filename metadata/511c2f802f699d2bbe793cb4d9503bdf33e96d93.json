In a poor,secluded mountain village, they won the hearts of the local people with their energy and kindness.\n\nBut in one sudden moment, everything went horribly wrong. A revolution swept the country. Now, guns and terror are everywhereÃ¢â‚¬â€and Americans are being targeted as the first to die.\n\nWill and his friends have got to get out fast. But streets full of killers . . .hills patrolled by armies . . . and a jungle rife with danger stand between them and the border. Their one hope of escape lies with a veteran warrior who has lost his faith and may betray them at any moment. Their one dream is to reach freedom and safety and home.\n\nIf they can just survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:511c2f802f699d2bbe793cb4d9503bdf33e96d93","amp;dn":"If+We+Survive+by+Andrew+Klavan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"511c2f802f699d2bbe793cb4d9503bdf33e96d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,28,47,128,47,105,157,43,190,121,60,180,217,80,59,223,51,233,109,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
