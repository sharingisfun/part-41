Stay away from men like me. You'll only get hurt.&quot; \n\nAt one time my life was simple. Easy. But that was before the war. Now I was no longer an average college student. I was a survivor. A woman living in a ravaged world. My future was not bright and my life was far from perfect. The war had taken so much from me... but it wasn't finished yet. It wanted more. It wanted my heart. My soul. The one person I couldn't live without. It wanted Ryder Delaney. My best friend. The bad boy. The one person who could fight like no other and love me like no one else. He was the father of my baby. I watched him walk away one hot summer day and I prayed he would return. I needed him like I needed air to breathe and water to drink. Without him I was lost. A light without her darkness. Until he returns, I'll wait for him. And I believe he will return because love is powerful... And so is the light calling him home.\n\nGenre: New Adult Science Fiction Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b3ab0b9b6c244c6041e000badbec28f740e8f4d","amp;dn":"Promise+Me+Light+-+Weaver%2C+Paige.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b3ab0b9b6c244c6041e000badbec28f740e8f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,58,176,185,182,194,68,198,4,30,0,11,173,190,194,143,116,14,143,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
