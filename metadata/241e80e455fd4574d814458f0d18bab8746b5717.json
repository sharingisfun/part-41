Providing a comprehensive examination of international potato production, this book identifies which storage systems suit particular climatic zones as well as considering interactions between crop microclimate, dehydration, crop cooling, condensation and disease development. Potatoes Postharvest will guide the reader through the activities following harvest from store loading, store management, and grading to packaging and dispatch.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:241e80e455fd4574d814458f0d18bab8746b5717","amp;dn":"+Potatoes+Postharvest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"241e80e455fd4574d814458f0d18bab8746b5717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,30,128,228,85,253,69,116,216,20,69,143,13,24,186,184,116,107,87,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
