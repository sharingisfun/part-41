Followers of Skelton's Sustain-Release catalogue will notice that limited CD-R editions called Crow Autumn and Crow Autumn Part Two have already been released in 2007 and 2009, respectively, but this new Tompkins Square volume finds the composer reworking the material. For example, the first Crow Autumn consisted of a single twenty-minute track, but here the piece is split into a shorter sequence of tracks ('Day Reveals', 'A Mercy Kill' and 'Like Rain') before Crow Autumn Part Two reappears in its entirety, suffixed by new piece, 'Leaves'. In compositional terms you might think of Skelton in the same way as you would Wiliam Basinski, for example: here's an artist who has spent their career honing their own specific oeuvre using a very personal set of techniques. If you've been keeping up with his recent run of releases you won't necessarily find a radical change of course for Crow Autumn, but you will be in for a glorious forty-five minutes of passionately performed, wonderfully organic string music that sounds utterly unlike anyone else. Excellent, as ever.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19fb8e63041e174b89e05f1839117791f4e40203","amp;dn":"A+Broken+Consort+-+Crow+Autumn+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19fb8e63041e174b89e05f1839117791f4e40203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,251,142,99,4,30,23,75,137,224,95,24,57,17,119,145,244,228,2,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
