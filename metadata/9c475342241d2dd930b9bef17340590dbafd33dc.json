Dvorak\n&quot;Your Gitmo Nation Media Assassination&quot;\nSunday, 25 March 2012\nEpisode No. 394\n&quot;No Bagels for You!&quot;\n\n\n\nThe usual eclectic mix of politics and culture, news and commentary.\n\nTOPICS: Elite$, EUROland, Gold CIA vs NIA, Bank$ters, Iran, Kossovo, Somalia, Friends of Syria, Leviathan Project, Leviathan II - TAPI, Yemen, Drone Nation, Gitmo Nation, NDAA, Actors, GOP XFactor, Obama Re-election Scampaign, Shut Up Slave!, Generic = Dangerous, Techno Experts, Haiti, Ministry of Truth, Vaccine$... and much more.\n\n\n\nFor links to the various stories discussed in this podcast, go to http://394.nashownotes.com/#shownotes\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n===========================================\n\nWhat started as a simple conversation between friends has now become one of the most intriguing alternative news sources on the Web. No Agenda began simply enough, in late 2007, as an unscripted, unrehearsed and unedited dialog between MEVIO President and Co-Founder Adam Curry, and MEVIO VP John C. Dvorak. Sometimes recorded over a meal, sometimes over the Net, their premise was to create a stripped-down show with &quot;no sponsors, no jingles and no agenda.&quot; Initially they talked about the news of the day, tech developments, and Silicon Valley scuttlebutt - and even included restaurant reviews, wine ratings and things that were going on in their personal lives. Although those subjects are certainly still on the table, the focus of the program has shifted more toward global politics and other topics from perspectives not usually found in so called &quot;mainstream&quot; media. In fact, Dvorak and Curry lambaste big media, drawing attention to its endless fascination with insignificant drivel (celebrity gossip, etc.) and its hesitance to cover important stories with any depth or insight.\n\n&quot;Crackpot&quot; (Curry) and &quot;Buzzkill&quot; (Dvorak) focus on stories that you might not hear about otherwise, from sometimes opposing, but always complementary, points of view - with Curry playing the outlandish conspiracy theorist and Dvorak the hard-nosed pragmatist - though surprisingly they sometimes switch roles depending on the topic and their individual depth of knowledge on a particular subject.\n\nTo this day No Agenda remains unscripted and unfiltered. Wherever the discussion may go, you'll be enlightened, informed, entertained, and perhaps sometimes incensed - but you'll never listen to the news in quite the same way again.\n\n===========================================\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c475342241d2dd930b9bef17340590dbafd33dc","amp;dn":"No+Agenda+-+2012+Mar+25+SU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c475342241d2dd930b9bef17340590dbafd33dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,71,83,66,36,29,45,217,48,185,190,241,115,64,89,13,186,253,51,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
