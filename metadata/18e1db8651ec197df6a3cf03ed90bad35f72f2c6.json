The film stars Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, Dean Jagger, Brian Donlevy and Jane Darwell. It has also been released under the title: Brigham Young: Frontiersman. \n \nIt's well-made historical fiction about the Mormon wagon train migration to Utah. While not a classic, it is a good example of solid studio craftsmanship which compares well to other wagon train epics such as John Ford's Wagon Master and another film about Mormon pioneers, Westward the Women.\n\nDean Jagger plays the title role, while Vincent Price plays Mormon church founder Joseph Smith. Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell provide romantic appeal as a young couple who are part of the wagon train. The excellent supporting cast also includes Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, Jane Darwell, John Carradine, Ann E. Todd, Dickie Jones, and Moroni Olsen. \n\nTaking the favorable factual aspects of the trek of Mormons to the west, and combining them with well-concocted fictional ingredients, picture emerges as an epic filmization of early American history.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dramatic power in the persecution of the Mormons in their settlement at Nauvoo, Illinois; the murder of Joseph Smith; and the resultant decision of Brigham Young to lead his flock across the plains to their eventual home on the shores of Salt Lake. Adversity hits the entourage at every turn, but, despite recalcitrants in the ranks, Young commands attention with a most dominating personality which is most vividly depicted.\n\nYoung (Dean Jagger) and his first and favorite wife,Mary Ann (Mary Astor),who never shares the frame with another Mrs Young.\n\nAnd no, Power does not take Gene Tierney, Alice Faye, Carole Landis, Lynn Bari and other Fox vixens as sister wives.\n[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/850/w2jp.jpg[/img] \nVincent Price, then in the third year of his movie career,Brigham Young was only the eighth of his 199 credits.\n\nThis movie had a lingering effect on the man who played the title role. In 1972 Jagger was baptized as a Latter-day Saint.
