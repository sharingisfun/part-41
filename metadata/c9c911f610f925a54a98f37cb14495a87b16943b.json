Through the series, Attenborough gives viewers a fascinating guide to the world's tribal art traveling to intriguing places and tribal communities.\n\nAttenborough's love of tribal art grew out of his early programme-making days at the BBC and took him to all corners of the world. From his first trips he accumulated souvenirs and eventually became a serious collector of tribal art. This series was commissioned shortly after he resigned from his job as Director of Programmes. He believed there was room on television for totem poles and masks as well as old master paintings. The resulting lavish series examined sculpture, weaving, metal casting and other artistic activities in tribal societies around the world.\n\nSubtitles &gt;&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c911f610f925a54a98f37cb14495a87b16943b","amp;dn":"BBC.The.Tribal.Eye.Part1of7.Behind.The.Mask.XviD.AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c911f610f925a54a98f37cb14495a87b16943b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,201,17,246,16,249,37,165,74,152,243,124,177,68,149,168,123,22,148,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
