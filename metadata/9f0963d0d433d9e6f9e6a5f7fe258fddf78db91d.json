Included in the films revisited in this episode are Whicker's earliest surviving TV appearance, in-depth profiles of John Paul Getty and Baroness Fiona Thyssen, and a legendary encounter with millionaire Yorkshireman and eccentric Percy Shaw - the man who invented cats' eyes. Finally, the remarkable story of what happened when Whicker became the first man to enter a closed and silent order of nuns - and got them to talk to him.\n\nTechnical Specs for Std-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CAVLC\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kb/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFrame Rate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 840MB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVD\n\nforums dot mvgroup dot org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f0963d0d433d9e6f9e6a5f7fe258fddf78db91d","amp;dn":"BBC+Alan+Whickers+Journey+of+a+Lifetime+1of4+DVDRip+x264+576p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f0963d0d433d9e6f9e6a5f7fe258fddf78db91d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,9,99,208,212,51,217,230,249,230,165,247,254,37,143,221,247,141,185,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
