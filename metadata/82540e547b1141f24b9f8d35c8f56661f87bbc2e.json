This third-year undergraduate and then graduate course designed by W. Kinzel and G. Reents is a supplement to any course in theoretical physics and aims at good techniques for problem-solving using the computer. The computer programs presented in this book are based on Mathematica and C and are written for PCs and Workstations. 40 detailed examples from different physical disciplines together with source files and graphics routines help the student gain thorough experience right from the start.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTorrent contents:\n\n* Scanned book found on the net.\n\n* Contents of CD-ROM from rented book at uni's library.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82540e547b1141f24b9f8d35c8f56661f87bbc2e","amp;dn":"Physics+by+Computer+-+Kinzel+-+Reents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82540e547b1141f24b9f8d35c8f56661f87bbc2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,84,14,84,123,17,65,242,75,159,141,53,200,245,102,97,248,123,188,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
