It was produced by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, and its showrunners were Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman. The first season introduces a Federal Bureau of Investigation &quot;Fringe Division&quot; team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses unorthodox &quot;fringe&quot; science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe. FBI agent Olivia Dunham is portrayed by actress Anna Torv, while actors Joshua Jackson and John Noble play father-son duo Peter and Walter Bishop. Other regular cast members include Lance Reddick, Jasika Nicole, Blair Brown, Mark Valley, and Kirk Acevedo.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd2d5c43a5c07c6f0dbea1199333f2e2dcc58edc","amp;dn":"Fringe+Complete+Season+1+720p+HTDV+x264+-+GrGianno+%7Bgreek+subs%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd2d5c43a5c07c6f0dbea1199333f2e2dcc58edc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,45,92,67,165,192,124,111,13,190,161,25,147,51,242,226,220,197,142,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
