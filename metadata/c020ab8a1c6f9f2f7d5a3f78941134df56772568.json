Fifty-five bundles of 2012 music, and as December quickly winds down, this will be my final torrent of the year.  For anyone keeping count, the 55 bundles accounted for 1,461 Christian Releases.  If even one of those 1,461 products has blessed your life, be sure to support the Artist in their ministry, and most importantly, thank the Lord.  Because without Him, all of this would be pointless.\n\nThis 55th bundle includes the following 25 releases...\n\n * 7vnseal - 2012 - Daggers of Truth - Hosted By DJ Free\n * A Sudden Revive - 2012 - A Sudden Revive EP\n * Affector - 2012 - Harmagedon - Limited Edition\n * Antestor - 2012 - Omen\n * Avalon - 2012 - Number Ones\n * Awaken - 2012 - Let the Earth Sing Out\n * Benjamin Dunn And The Animal Orchestra - 2012 - Fable\n * Breaking The Chains - 2012 - Surrender EP\n * Brooke White - 2012 - White Christmas\n * Camo - 2012 - Real Talk For Fake People\n * David Olinger - 2012 - Hope\n * Debora Garcia - 2012 - It's Christmas Time, Es Navidad EP\n * Hotshot Freight Train, The - 2012 - Get Low\n * Jacob Thomas - 2012 - Footsteps\n * Jason Crabb - 2012 - Let Mercy Hold You - Single\n * Je'kob - 2012 - Love EP\n * Johnell Nicholas - 2012 - Declaration John 4-24\n * Moon Casale - 2012 - Moon Casale\n * Pillar - 2012 - God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen - Single\n * Raymond Gregory - 2012 - You Are Faithful\n * Spoken - 2012 - Through It All - Single\n * Taelor Gray - 2012 - Hopeless Romantic\n * Ultimate Karaoke Stars - 2012 - Great Great God Contemporary Christian Karaoke\n * Vineyard - 2012 - Not Be Moved - Live From The Southeast Vineyard Churches\n * Young Oceans - 2012 - Advent\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - December 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c020ab8a1c6f9f2f7d5a3f78941134df56772568","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+55+of+55%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c020ab8a1c6f9f2f7d5a3f78941134df56772568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,32,171,138,28,111,159,47,125,90,63,120,148,17,52,223,86,119,37,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
