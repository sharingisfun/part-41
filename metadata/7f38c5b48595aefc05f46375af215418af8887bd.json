Recorded in the British colonies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Northern Rhodesia, Portugese East Africa, and Belgian Congo. Some bands were professional outfits playing to Europeans, mostly in hotels, others were enthusiastic amateurs copying styles they heard on the radio and playing to mostly African audiences. One is immediately struck by the element of nostalgia, but more than anything we have very good musicians playing very interesting music, creating their own sounds and styles within the limits of self-censorship ('not too wild please!). Each and every one was a pioneer in their way, and deserve tremendous respect for that alone. \n\n01. Shabani Abdullah &amp; The Dar-Es-Salaam Jazz Band - Nani Aliemtia Bure\n02.
