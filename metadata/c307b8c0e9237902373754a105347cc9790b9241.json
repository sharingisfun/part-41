Give it a listen. Not into Latin or New Age or Flamenco? How about Latin New Age Flamenco!?! lol This is very lively music that still serves as nice background flavor. One thing is for certain is this is one of the best guitarist alive today.\n\nAnd....you guessed it. MP3 tags have been edited so Disc 1 and Disc 2 show up under 1 Album in most players. \n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n\n[quote]By H. L. Dietor on September\n\nIf you want music that will get you moving, yet be unabtrusive when necessary, this artist and his blend of flamenco meeting new age is for you. I've been listening to Cook for a few years now, having discovered him after my search for more music to expand my interest in acoustic guitar.\n\nFollowing Leibert, Cook is one of my favorites. He truly knows his way around a guitar. And while I can't say I equally love every cut on this compilation, overall, I enjoy this set very much.\n\nI know, I know, if you're a flamenco purist or snob, artists like him make you crazy and you'd never think to add him to your collection! But, for the rest of us who simply want something that makes us think, work by, relax by, entertain by, and makes you happy...well I don't think Cook can be beat. I'm hoping this really isn't The Ultimate Jesse Cook, because that would mean there's not much more to follow and I'm hoping for great new sounds from Cook for many listening years to come.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/bZOSnFguJw.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Jesse Cook - The Ultimate Jesse Cook\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Jesse Cook\nAlbum................: The Ultimate Jesse Cook\nGenre................: Latin\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2005 10 25\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 63 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Disc 1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

Many \nare CD's from the 80's which are important to archive because those old CD's \nare at the end of their lifecycles.\n\nThis download includes a volume that has been ripped at MP3 V0 \nwhich is nearly indistinguishable from FLAC using spectral analysis. It provides \nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size.
