I feel fortunate to have the files I do. I cannot find any info on the internet even about these besides they were fan made videos from 1993. (maybe you can find more I did not try very hard) See cover below. [color=Brown] Add:so I searched and the Final Cut videos are actually available on DVD... I have the DVD and will upload (cover below) [/color]\n\nIf anyone has these in higher quality please do upload until then enjoy these, and please do not post here complaining about the quality of the videos. I have announced its bad, any other info about these videos welcome. I have literally hundreds of rare rock videos all dvd quality I will upload some of them here if there is an audience. (these are some of the only avi's I have being they are so hard to find) A thank you or two would help the process. \n\n[img]http://i1244.photobucket.com/albums/gg572/the_rombus/ASaucerfullOfVideos.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i1244.photobucket.com/albums/gg572/the_rombus/DVD9000/FinalCut.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]I am looking for invites to more close-nit sharing communities.
