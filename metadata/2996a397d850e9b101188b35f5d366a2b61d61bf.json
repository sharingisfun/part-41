Here, Catherine Deneuve, tiring of being the glacial Grace Kelly type for Bunuel, Truffaut et les autres opts for very effective physical comedy alongside Yves Montand.\n\nThey do Cary Grant-Katharine Hepburn-style farcical routines very well. Deneuve, escaping from her frenetic fiance, hooks up with Montand, who is himself fleeing marital and business entanglements. Tony Roberts, seen in Woody Allen films of the period, does very well as the club owner from whom Deneuve steals a Toulouse-Lautrec, and who must track down the dizzy blonde in Venezuela to get it back. Jean-Paul Rappeneau's direction is accomplished and the scenery is gorgeous. There is a car chase that actually is funny, and I can't recall the last one that made me laugh.\n\nCaracas, Venezuela. Just after her engagement with Vittorio, Nelly runs away from him. As he pursued her, she looks for help to Martin, a French middle-aged man she met by accident. He helps her to escape and drives her to the airport and gives her a plane ticker to Paris. Then he thinks he can go back to his peaceful lonely life on his island. Of course, he is wrong and will be bothered again by Nelly...\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Le.Sauvage.1975.XviD.FZB\nFilesize.....: 700 MB (or 717,588 KB or 734,810,112 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:41:33 (152,326 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 907 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 50 kb/s, monophonic VBR \nFrame Size...: 576x352 (1.64:1) [=18:11]\n\nXvid 2pass of course...\n\nHave fun with that GREAT romantic (indeed, the end is very romantic) screwball comedy, Deneuve/Montand + Rappeneau = french classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2996a397d850e9b101188b35f5d366a2b61d61bf","amp;dn":"Le+Sauvage+1975+Rare+Deneuve+01+eng+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2996a397d850e9b101188b35f5d366a2b61d61bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,150,163,151,216,80,233,177,1,24,139,53,245,211,102,162,182,29,97,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
