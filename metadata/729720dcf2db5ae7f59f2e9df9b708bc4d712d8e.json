Did you know that the Federal Reserve Bank is a private corporation? That's right! The Fed is not federal and it sure has no reserves. Do you think your money, the funds paid to the IRS, go to pay the bills of the United States Government and to rebuild our infrastructure? Think again! The privately owned Fed has never been audited. Why? Do the Fed and its collection agency, the Internal Revenue Service violate your Constitutional rights? You bet! Does the Executive Branch and Congress know about this fraud? You say you want to take back America? Before you can accomplish this, you need to learn the real reason our Nation is broke. Why A Bankrupt America explains those reasons in simple language understandable for anyone. 45 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729720dcf2db5ae7f59f2e9df9b708bc4d712d8e","amp;dn":"Kidd-Why+Bankrupt+America-Exposing+Fed+Scam%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729720dcf2db5ae7f59f2e9df9b708bc4d712d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,151,32,220,242,219,90,231,245,159,46,157,249,183,8,188,77,113,45,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
