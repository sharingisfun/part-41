Twenty years later Jake returns to find Dan and Maddy married and running the farm with the help of their children and his father. Jacob's father is overjoyed at the return of his son, but feelings of bitterness arise between the brothers, and the complex feelings and needs of each family member come into play. Battling a mysterious blight that threatens to destroy the farm, they struggle to understand their fears, overcome the past and express their love.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFormat: mp4\n\nLanguage: English\n\nLength: 1:34:08\n\nResolution: 720x484\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109992/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109992/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nEverything I could find said the name of this movie is &quot;Harvest For The Heart&quot;.
