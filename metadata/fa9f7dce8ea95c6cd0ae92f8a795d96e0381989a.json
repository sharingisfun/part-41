Going back to his roots as he has not done in too\nmany years, Gill shines like God's brightest penny, and even Tony Brown's\nusual heavy-handed production style seems to be as light as an angel's\nfeather this time around. Gill is in fine voice throughout, joining with\na colorful cast of backup singers to create music that modern mainstream\ncountry radio has not played in well over a decade. With 13 tracks, Gill\neases gracefully from one style to another. From a classic hillbilly waltz\nto the edgy Bakersfield sound. He even skillfully tips his hat to guitar\ngreat Roy Nichols on the soon-to-be-classic &quot;There's Not Much Love Here\nAnymore.&quot; A duet with honky tonk songbird Patty Loveless, &quot;My Kind of Woman\n/My Kind of Man,&quot; stands proudly next to the best country duets by George\nand Tammy or Merle and Bonnie Owens. Most impressive is &quot;Kindly Keep It\nCountry,&quot; a stone-cold country hit that details one man's heartbreak and\nthe soothing effects of a jukebox and a bar stool. As heartbreaking as any\nsong ever written is &quot;Let Her In,&quot; told from the perspective of a divorced\nfather who is trying to rebuild his life and still retain his relationship\nwith his daughter. Just as effective is &quot;The Hills of Caroline,&quot; a mountain\ntune with a strong melody and story that is enhanced by the beautiful backing\nvocals of Alison Krauss. The title cut, which is also the final cut, is\nendearing and comes directly from Gill's relationship with his late father.\nFor emotional depth, honesty, and musical accomplishment, this is certainly\nGill's crowning achievement to date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa9f7dce8ea95c6cd0ae92f8a795d96e0381989a","amp;dn":"Vince+Gill+-+The+Key+%281998%29+%28%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa9f7dce8ea95c6cd0ae92f8a795d96e0381989a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,159,125,206,142,169,92,108,208,174,146,248,167,149,217,110,3,129,152,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
