Halcyon Way have reached their fourth full-length record, and at this stage their own direction is well defined with an electric accessibility being the focus of their aims.\n\nTheir latest effort Conquer finds the band firmly establishing their own sound, and it possesses a thrashing intensity propelled with an immediacy that comes across as resolved yet rigid, as the melodic structures are upheld by resoundingly heavy and omnipresent guitar work, the resulting sound being ably fixed into position by the dominant march of mid-paced rhythms.
