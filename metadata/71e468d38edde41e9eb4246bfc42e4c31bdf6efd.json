Left out their more &quot;popular&quot; releases as R&amp;S to keep the vocals to a minimum. The Versions is the instrumental version of their most popular release, Rhythm &amp; Sound w/ the Artists.\r\n\r\nRound One to Round Five are described as house, but it mostly sounds like dub techno to me. Beware, there be vocals here.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAll tracks have been &quot;remastered&quot; by me, meaning that long silences at the beginning and end of tracks have been removed.\r\n\r\n160kbps mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e468d38edde41e9eb4246bfc42e4c31bdf6efd","amp;dn":"Basic+Channel+Collection+%281993-2004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e468d38edde41e9eb4246bfc42e4c31bdf6efd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,228,104,211,142,221,228,30,158,180,36,107,252,66,228,195,27,223,110,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
