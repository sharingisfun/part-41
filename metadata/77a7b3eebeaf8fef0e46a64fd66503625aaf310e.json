As far as I know there is no actual published comic book title for Lara Jones, only excerpts from Eros Comix. Such is the case with the five comic books posted here: the first, &quot;Lara Jones and The Amazons&quot;, is feature-length and complete, depicting the origins of the title character, obviously a blonde, uninhibited hybrid of the fictional Indiana Jones and Lara Croft, in comic book format (CBZ); and the rest a compilation of the stories &quot;Stressful Day&quot;, &quot;Treasure of Osiris&quot;, &quot;The Hammer of Thor&quot; and &quot;The Final Penetration,&quot; all were translated from the original Spanish by a certain Regdul14 and then scanned by a certain Halibut72. Suffice it to say that certainly because of the author-artist, the plots are surprisingly above average for the genre with great and distinctive artwork. Even so, graphic and explicit.
