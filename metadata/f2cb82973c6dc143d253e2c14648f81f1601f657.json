As for the 'plot', well this one seems to be heavily influenced by Jess\nFranco's WHITE CANNIBAL QUEEN. An essential for the adventurous cinema lovers!\n\nA holy grail of the cannibals-in-the-jungle genre, Ratno Timoer's 'Jungle Heat'\nis a much better entry than S.G. Putra's 'Primitives'. You'll enjoy it, take my\nword for it!\n\nThanks to original ripper Malignus.
