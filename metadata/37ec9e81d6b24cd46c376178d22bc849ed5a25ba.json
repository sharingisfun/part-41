It was issued as the second single from the band's debut album Dreamboat Annie. Written by Ann and Nancy Wilson, the song is sung from the viewpoint of a young girl who is being seduced by an older man (referred to as a Magic Man), much to the chagrin of her mother, who begs the girl to come home.\n\n&quot;Magic Man&quot; became Heart's first Top 10 hit in the United States, peaking at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nHeart is a rock band whose founding members came from Seattle, Washington in the early 1970s. Going through several lineup changes, the only constant members of the group are sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. The group rose to fame in the 1970s with their music being influenced by hard rock as well as folk music. After diminishing in popularity by the mid-1980s, the band created a major comeback in 1985 experiencing further success with their power ballads throughout the rest of the decade. By the mid-1990s, Heart left their 1980s' sound and went back to their hard rock roots which they continue to play today. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide.\n\nHeart was ranked #57 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ec9e81d6b24cd46c376178d22bc849ed5a25ba","amp;dn":"Heart+-+Magic+Man+%28Live%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ec9e81d6b24cd46c376178d22bc849ed5a25ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,236,158,129,214,178,76,212,108,55,97,120,210,43,200,73,237,90,37,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
