Kennedy is dead.\n\nLife can turn on a dimeÃ¢â‚¬â€or stumble into the extraordinary, as it does for Jake Epping, a high school English teacher in a Maine town. While grading essays by his GED students, Jake reads a gruesome, enthralling piece penned by janitor Harry Dunning: fifty years ago, Harry somehow survived his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sledgehammer slaughter of his entire family. Jake is blown away . . . but an even more bizarre secret comes to light when JakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend Al, owner of the local diner, enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsessionÃ¢â‚¬â€to prevent the Kennedy assassination. How? By stepping through a portal in the dinerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s storeroom, and into the era of Ike and Elvis, of big American cars, sock hops, and cigarette smoke. . . . Finding himself in warmhearted Jolie, Texas, Jake begins a new life. But all turns in the road lead to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. The course of history is about to be rewritten . . . and become heart-stoppingly suspenseful.\n\nIn Stephen KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“most ambitious and accomplishedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (NPR) novel, time travel has never been so believable.
