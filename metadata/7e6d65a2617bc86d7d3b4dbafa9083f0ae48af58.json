W. Walbank, A. E. Astin, M. W. Frederiksen and R. M. Ogilvie\nPublication Date: 1984\nHardback ISBN-10 052123445x, Hardback ISBN-13 9780521234450\nDigital Object Identifier (DOI): 10.1017/CHOL9780521234450\n\nOverview:\nPublished in 1928, Volume VII of the Cambridge Ancient History orginally covered both the history of the Hellenistic world from the battle of Ipsus in 301 BC down to the Peace of Naupactus and the battle of Raphia in 217 BC and the history of Rome from its foundation down to the same date. In the new edition the Greek and Roman sections have been assigned to two separate volumes. Of these, VII part I opens after the death of Alexander, in 323 BC, as being a more logical starting-point for Hellenistic history; but 217 has been retained as the terminal date since, as Polybius noted, it is from then onwards that Rome begins to play a substantial role in Greek affairs. The volume has been completely rewritten by specialists from Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Canada, and takes full account of the vast amount of new material that has become available in the last fifty years. Separate chapters deal with the main kingdoms - Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Asia and Macedonia - and with mainland Greece, Sicily and the smaller states including Pergamum. Political events are fully described and assessed, but there is less emphasis on military detail than in the first edition. The space thus saved has been given over to chapters on the historical sources, on the institution of monarchy and the ideology surrounding it, on the main cultural, social and economic aspects of the Hellenistic world and on the development of Hellenistic science, especially in relation to its application in peace and war. This up-to-date and authoritative account of the early Hellenistic world is designed to serve both the student and the general reader of this and subsequent generations as the first edition has served those of the last fifty years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e6d65a2617bc86d7d3b4dbafa9083f0ae48af58","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Ancient+History+Vol+07%2C+Part+01+-+The+Hellenistic+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e6d65a2617bc86d7d3b4dbafa9083f0ae48af58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,109,101,162,97,123,200,109,125,59,77,186,250,144,131,240,174,72,175,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
