Much like his first studio album, half of Closer's songs are sung in English, with the remainder sung in various other languages (Italian, Spanish, and French).\n\nThe album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, selling about 375,000 copies in its first week. In January 2004, the album rose from number 11 to number one in its ninth week on the chart, selling about 110,000 copies that week. This followed a sales campaign by Target.\n\nIn Australia it reached a peak position of 25 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. On the 13th June 2007, it re-entered the charts at 39. As of June, 2009, the album has sold over 5,759,000 copies in the United States. The track &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; charted at #73 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart also. The track &quot;Remember When it Rained&quot; peaked at #15 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nJoshua Winslow &quot;Josh&quot; Groban (born February 27, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter. He has concentrated his career so far mostly in concert singing and recordings, although he has stated that he wishes to pursue music theatre in the future. As of July 2009, he has sold 19,147,000 albums in the United States alone.\n\nGroban's second album Closer was released on November 11, 2003. Groban said that he believed that this second album was a better reflection of him, and that his audience would be able to get a better idea of his personally from listening to it. &quot;What most people know about me, they know through my music. This time, I've tried to open that door as wide as possible. These songs are a giant step closer to who I really am and what my music is all about. Hence the title.&quot;\n\nTwo months after Closer was released, it rose on the Billboard charts from number 11 to number one. His cover of Brian Kennedy's &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; became very popular on the adult contemporary charts, even featuring as the debut song for the always-popular Lakehouse 2008. Groban also performed the song &quot;Remember&quot; (with Tanja Tzarovska) on the Troy soundtrack, &quot;Believe&quot; on the soundtrack to the 2004 animated film The Polar Express, and a cover of Linkin Park's &quot;My December&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe9c16f98fc8173097efcdf853307fb54362126e","amp;dn":"Josh+Groban+-+Per+Te++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe9c16f98fc8173097efcdf853307fb54362126e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,156,22,249,143,200,23,48,151,239,205,248,83,48,127,181,67,98,18,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
