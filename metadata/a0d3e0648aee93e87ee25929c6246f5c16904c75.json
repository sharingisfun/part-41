Born and raised in Mobile, Alabama, Hall cofounded Wet Willie in 1970; over the next ten years, Hall and the group toured with Aerosmith, the Allman Brothers Band, Grand Funk Railroad and the Grateful Dead. Hall was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocalist for Jeff Beck's 1985 Flash album. After Wet Willie's breakup, Hall moved to Nashville to work on a solo project for Epic Records, and he's been based there ever since, finding a healthy blues scene in a city known for country music. On his 1996 effort Rendezvous With The Blues, Hall is backed by people like Clayton Ivey on piano, former Capricorn session drummer Bill Stewart, and Dr. Dan Matrazzo on Hammond B-3 organ; the record also features Johnny Sandlin, the same producer who sat behind the console on Wet Willie's 1973 live album Drippin' Wet. In recent years, Hall joined Hank Williams Jr's touring band playing sax and harmonica.\n\nSource:AMG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0d3e0648aee93e87ee25929c6246f5c16904c75","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Hall+-+2+Albums+%28Wet+Willie+Frontman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0d3e0648aee93e87ee25929c6246f5c16904c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,211,224,100,138,238,147,232,126,226,89,41,198,36,111,92,22,144,76,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
