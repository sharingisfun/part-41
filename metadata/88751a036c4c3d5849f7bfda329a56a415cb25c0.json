After the album was released, they created the Another Roadside Attraction festival ? this name was another joke referring to &quot;road apples.&quot; The album was recorded in New Orleans, and although most of the songs were finished by the time they arrived, &quot;Little Bones&quot; was inspired by a local taxi driver.\n\nThe album is often cited by fans and critics as the band&amp;#039;s finest work. As with most Tragically Hip albums, Canadian themes appear in the album&amp;#039;s lyrics. &quot;Three Pistols&quot; is an English translation of the name of the Quebec town Trois-Pistoles, and refers to Tom Thomson, a Canadian painter, as well as Remembrance Day, the Canadian commemorative day for its war dead. &quot;The Luxury&quot; refers to the fleur-de-lis, provincial symbol of Quebec, while &quot;Born in the Water&quot; is about the controversy surrounding Ontario municipalities (particularly Sault Ste. Marie) declaring themselves &quot;English-only&quot; in the dying days of the Meech Lake Accord debate.\n\nAll songs were written and performed by The Tragically Hip.\n\n\n\n\nSingles\n\n&quot;Little Bones&quot; \n&quot;Twist My Arm&quot; \n&quot;Cordelia&quot; \n&quot;Long Time Running&quot; \n&quot;Three Pistols&quot; \n&quot;Fiddler&amp;#039;s Green&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88751a036c4c3d5849f7bfda329a56a415cb25c0","amp;dn":"The+Tragically+Hip+-+1991+-+Road+Apples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88751a036c4c3d5849f7bfda329a56a415cb25c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,117,26,3,108,76,61,88,73,247,191,218,50,154,86,164,21,203,37,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
