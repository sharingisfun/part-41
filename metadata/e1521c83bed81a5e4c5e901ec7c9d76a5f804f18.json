This absorbing history of the Second Corps follows the unit's creation and rise to prominence, the battles that earned it a reputation for hard fighting, and the legacy its veterans sought to maintain in the years after the Civil War. More than an account of battles, Defeating Lee gets to the heart of what motivated these men, why they fought so hard, and how they sustained a spirited defense of cause and country long after the guns had fallen silent.\n(2011)\n\n# Paperback: 416 pages\n# Publisher: Indiana University Press; Reprint edition (December 29, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0253006171\n# ISBN-13: 978-0253006172","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1521c83bed81a5e4c5e901ec7c9d76a5f804f18","amp;dn":"Defeating+Lee+++%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1521c83bed81a5e4c5e901ec7c9d76a5f804f18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,82,28,131,190,216,26,94,76,94,144,30,199,201,215,106,95,128,79,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
