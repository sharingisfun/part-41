The long-awaited development environment finally allowed developers to design commercial applications for the iPhone, and provided a distribution channel capable of reaching every single iPhone user. This book covers the officially sanctioned Apple SDK and subsequent APIs used to develop applications specifically tailored to the AppStore.\n\nThe Apple SDK represented great progress in mobile software development, and provided a fantastic open door for the quintessential &quot;overnight millionaire&quot; to walk through. As an SDK developer, you have a direct channel to millions of end users who have the opportunity to instantly purchase your product. The long-awaited removal of Apple's NDA further helped to culminate a significant enthusiasm for this fantastic device and business model. There is no doubt a great opportunity for innovation and profit with the iPhone SDK.\n\nThis enthusiasm must be tempered with realistic expectations, however. As an iPhone developer, you'll be designing on a platform that is still considered by and large a closed device. Your applications will run in a restrictive sandbox to prevent certain types of access, and Apple has restricted you from using many private APIs that can access more powerful resources on the device. You'll need to be aware of your environment's limitations so you don't burn hours on code with incorrect assumptions about what you can do.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66eec59744694a8b7f55281be6cceaf4001a4251","amp;dn":"Iphone+SDK+Application+Development%2C+1st+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66eec59744694a8b7f55281be6cceaf4001a4251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,238,197,151,68,105,74,139,127,85,40,27,230,204,234,244,0,26,66,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
