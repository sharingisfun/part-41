His brilliance was allied with a certain stubbornness, and when he died in 1994, at the age of 93, he was embroiled in controversy regarding his advocacy of vitamin C as a treatment for cancer. Based on thirty years of interviews, this masterful biography is filled with insights into the life and work of this complex, fascinating man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83eecfccdadf8441277eb953893440bb61823275","amp;dn":"Linus+Pauling%3A+A+Life+In+Science+And+Politics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83eecfccdadf8441277eb953893440bb61823275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,238,207,204,218,223,132,65,39,126,185,83,137,52,64,187,97,130,50,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
