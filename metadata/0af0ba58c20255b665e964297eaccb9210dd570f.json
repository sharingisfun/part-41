However I do offer the \nfollowing recording for you delectation.\n\nThis was recorded for a Los Angeles radio station in June 2011 and gives the \nbriefest taste of his remarkable talents.\n\nShould you wish to know more about Michael and his work, please visit \n\nwww.michaelchapman.co.uk \n\nOr\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chapman_(musician)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chapman_(musician)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlternatively just check the usual sources for video clips.\n\nMichaelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work will appeal to anyone who enjoys\n\nJohn Fahey\nRoy Harper\nBert Jansch\nLeo Kottke\nNick Drake\nJackson C Frank\nBob Dylan\nJohn Martyn\nTownes Van Zandt\n\nMore unreleased Michael Chapman to follow\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0af0ba58c20255b665e964297eaccb9210dd570f","amp;dn":"MC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0af0ba58c20255b665e964297eaccb9210dd570f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,240,186,88,194,2,85,182,101,233,100,41,126,172,203,146,16,221,87,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
