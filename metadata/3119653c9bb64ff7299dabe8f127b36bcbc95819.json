Its cast features a virtual who's who of the Hong Kong film world. The movie is less a straightforward action thriller than a visually striking meditation on memory and love.  This film is one of the most celebrated examples of 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hong Kong cinema: it won multiple awards in its native Hong Kong, along with a Golden Osella for Best Cinematography at the 1994 Venice Film Festival.  \n\n*In the years following Ashes of Time's initial theatrical release in 1994, the original negatives were lost.  With ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ashes of Time ReduxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, the director restructures the film according to seasons, effectively clarifying the central narratives, and digitally colorizes the film to render cinematographer Christopher Doyle's masterful imagery all the more lavish and intoxicatingly gorgeous. \n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ashes of Time ReduxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a visual treat of action among swirling sands and beautiful, treacherous landscapes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the result is a stirring sensory experience.  When this redux was screened at the New York Film Festival in 2008, one reviewer called it &quot;insanely gorgeous&quot;.\n\nGenre: Action  Drama\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1233247/\nIMDB Rating: 7.5/10   (585 votes)\nRuntime: 1hr 33min\nLanguage: Cantonese Chinese (Good English subtitles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ hardcoded)\nRated R(USA) and 15(UK) for violence\n\nMore info: http://www.sonyclassics.com/ashesoftimeredux/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3119653c9bb64ff7299dabe8f127b36bcbc95819","amp;dn":"Ashes+of+Time+Redux%2FDungchesaiduk-2008%2A%28Good+English+subtitles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3119653c9bb64ff7299dabe8f127b36bcbc95819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,25,101,60,155,182,79,247,41,157,171,232,241,39,179,107,203,201,88,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
