But when she wakes up under an alley Dumpster with a badly burned arm, an aching back, superhuman strength, and a distinctly Nosferatuan thirst, she realizes the decision has been made for her.\n\nMaking the transition from the nine-to-five grind to an eternity of nocturnal prowlings is going to take some doing, however, and that's where C. Thomas Flood fits in. A would-be Kerouac from Incontinence, Indiana, Tommy (to his friends) is biding his time night-clerking and frozen-turkey bowling in a San Francisco Safeway. But all that changes when a beautiful undead redhead walks through the door...and proceeds to rock Tommy's life -- and afterlife -- in ways he never thought possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:938145bd4f2141335ad6de86c46b6b223e49da35","amp;dn":"Bloodsucking+fiends_+a+love+story+-+Christopher+Moore-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"938145bd4f2141335ad6de86c46b6b223e49da35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,129,69,189,79,33,65,51,90,214,222,134,196,107,107,34,62,73,218,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
