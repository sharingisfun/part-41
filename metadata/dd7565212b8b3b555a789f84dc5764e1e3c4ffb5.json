By the time it was finished, however, Messina had written or co-written six of the 11 songs, contributed &quot;first guitar,&quot; and shared lead vocals on many tracks. Messina's &quot;Nobody but You&quot; and &quot;Vahevala,&quot; co-written by Loggins' second cousin, Dave Loggins, were the singles chart entries, but today everybody remembers the album for Loggins' &quot;House at Pooh Corner,&quot; which had earned Loggins his record contract, and &quot;Danny's Song,&quot; which Anne Murray took into the Top Ten the following year. The only thing wrong with this record is that it was too perfect -- with their infectious blend of country, folk, rock and Caribbean music, L&amp;M started out at the top of their game, and although they were able to match some of the material and performances on later records, the team never got any better than this. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd7565212b8b3b555a789f84dc5764e1e3c4ffb5","amp;dn":"Loggins+%26+Messina+-+Sittin+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd7565212b8b3b555a789f84dc5764e1e3c4ffb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,117,101,33,43,139,59,85,90,120,159,132,220,87,100,225,227,196,255,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
