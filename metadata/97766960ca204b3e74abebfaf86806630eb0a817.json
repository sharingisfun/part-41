Derrick, a determined inner city teenager realizes his dream of becoming a champion boxer despite a country, community and family conflicted by divisive political system.\n\nDerrick dreams of being JamaicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next world light weight boxing champion. He knew from an early age that he had the ability to out box even the bigger boys on his lane but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s election year and politics divide the country and DerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s community. His father, a loyal party supporter, forbids Derrick from going to the boxing gym, as to do so he has to cross party lines.\n\nDerrick defiantly follows his heart and is confronted with the serious repercussions of his decision. The don of DerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s community, Sin, is set on keeping him from crossing over to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“other sideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ even if it means destroying DerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream and DerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father is so blinded by political tribalism that he sees DerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions as betrayal. On the Ã¢â‚¬Å“other sideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ , at the gym, is a coach who becomes DerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mentor and someone who shows him that Jamaica is bigger than just one community and that DerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams are worth fighting for.\n\nDerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey of discovery takes the audience through his coming of age and the realisation that anything that divides cannot be good for anyone. The ignorance of divisiveness gives way to the triumph that comes with unity.\n\nGHETTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢A LIFE is a wholly Jamaican film with all investors, cast and crew being committed to an authentic depiction of what life is and what life can be in the inner city of Kingston. This film with itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s positive message of overcoming adversity and ignorance will inspire audiences at home and abroad.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97766960ca204b3e74abebfaf86806630eb0a817","amp;dn":"GHETT+A+LIFE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97766960ca204b3e74abebfaf86806630eb0a817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,118,105,96,202,32,75,62,116,171,235,250,248,104,6,99,14,176,168,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
