Light? Big? Small? SlideIT has many different skins with a polished, clear look at any keyboard size and resolution available for download. So everybody can choose a look and size to match their preference.\nPredictive Sliding\nSlideIT is the only available solution that supports predictive text suggestions while sliding. Other applications provide prediction only when tapping.\n\nAccuracy\n\nYou donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to be accurate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dasur's pattern recognition engine provides the precision. SlideIT has the unique ability to recognize a word even when the sliding path is highly distorted. In regular daily use, the SlideIT recognition rate remains very high, even when the user slides quickly and with low accuracy.\n\nFastest Learning Curve\n\nFeedback indicates that it usually takes a few minutes to get used to the application, and within a few hours, users double and triple their writing speed.\n\nLightweight Application\n\nSlideIT requires few resources on your touch screen device, using under 2 MB of memory per language (for the dictionary). DasurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s optimized engine uses minimal CPU and saves on battery power consumption.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0dfe7b004bad94101f0942b82d59a2fdd6bcdce","amp;dn":"SlideIt+Keyboard+ver.4.0+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0dfe7b004bad94101f0942b82d59a2fdd6bcdce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,223,231,176,4,186,217,65,1,240,148,43,130,213,154,47,221,107,205,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
