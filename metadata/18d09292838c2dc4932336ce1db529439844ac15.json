The result was a string of hit albums and singles in the early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s, highlighted by Ã¢â‚¬Å“Caught Up in You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“If IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d Been the One,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back Where You Belong,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Like No Other Night.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ .38 SpecialÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popularity dipped in the late Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s as MTV-sponsored pop and heavy metal cut into their audience. Though the band had its biggest hit in 1989 with the ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“Second Chance,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it proved to be their last gasp Ã¢â‚¬â€ they faded away in the early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s, retiring to the oldies circuit.\nDonnie Van Zant (vocals) formed the Jacksonville, FL-based .38 Special in 1975 with Jeff Carlisi (guitar), Don Barnes (guitar, vocals), Ken Lyons (bass), Jack Grondin (drums), and Steve Brookins (drums). Two years later, the band signed with A&amp;M Records and released its eponymous debut. Neither 38 Special or its follow-up, Special Delivery, received much attention, but the group began to build up a following through its constant touring. Bassist Lyons left before the recording of 1979's RockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Into the Night, the album that demonstrated a more melodic, driving sound; he was replaced by Larry Junstrom. RockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Into the Night became a moderate hit, but 1981's Wild-Eyed Southern Boys was a genuine hit, going platinum and generating the Top 40 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hold On Loosely.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Special Forces, released in 1982, was even more popular, spawning the Top Ten single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Caught Up in You.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Tour de Force (1983) and Strength in Numbers (1986) were both successes, and the band continued to be a popular touring outfit. Barnes and Brookins left in 1987; Barnes was replaced by Danny Chauncey.\n\nWhile Strength in Numbers had been popular, it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay on the charts as long as its predecessors. Flashback, the 1987 greatest-hits album, was moderately successful, but the band took precautions to retain its audience by recording the polished Rock &amp; Roll Strategy. Released in 1989, the album slowly became a hit on the strength of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Second Chance,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an adult contemporary-oriented ballad that reached the Top Ten. Rock &amp; Roll Strategy became the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final big hit. Barnes returned to the band in 1991 and the group added drummer Scott Hoffman and keyboardist Bobby Capps. Even with the extensive retooling and the support of a new label, Charisma, 1991's Bone Against Steel failed to gain much attention. .38 Special didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t release another album for six years. In the summer of 1997, they released a comeback effort titled Resolution on Razor &amp; Tie Records. Live at Sturgis followed on CMC in 1999.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18d09292838c2dc4932336ce1db529439844ac15","amp;dn":"38+Special+-+38+Special+%282014%29+Japanese+Limited+Edition+FLAC+Beo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18d09292838c2dc4932336ce1db529439844ac15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,208,146,146,131,140,45,196,147,35,54,206,29,181,41,67,152,68,172,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
