So don&amp;#039;t do it...or get caught doing it...\n\nThis is the first disk of the US NTSC version of Xenosaga Episode 1: Der Wille Zie Macht. I ripped it from my version as the Sir Alucard torrent is pretty much dead. I&amp;#039;ll seed as long as I can, but please seed as much as you download! I&amp;#039;ll upload disk 2 as soon as I verify it works correctly and have enough peopl seeding disk 1 - usual rules folks!\n\nI haven&amp;#039;t split it into a multi-part file as some people find them difficult to use and aren&amp;#039;t sure what to do with them. This file is an\niso, so you should be able to burn it using Nero, Alcohol or any number of burning programs. Personally, I recommend Alcohol 120% for this game.\n\nI also recommend high quality DVD disks! I can&amp;#039;t stress that enough! Don&amp;#039;t drop a comment about it not working if you&amp;#039;re using crappy disks, as that&amp;#039;s probably your problem, not the iso. This works on my ancient, first model, flip-lid-added PS2, so hopefully you shouldn&amp;#039;t have any problems.\n\nNow for the specific stuff:\n\n*ISO format file\n*4.16GB in size (Disk 1)\n*4.36GB in size (Disk 2)\n*4.16GB in size (Disk 3)\n\n(Slightly different from the read me file - I screwed up, this torrent took 11 hours to rip and zip, so sue me!)\n*SAVE AT THE ELSA AT THE ABANDONED PORT!!! On disk 1 this is the point where the disk will crash after you tell Matthews you&amp;#039;re ready to leave, and so you need to save on the ship before then. When the disk ends, switch off your console, boot up Swap Magic (if you&amp;#039;re not modded) and then boot up the second disk. Load your save and &amp;#039;viola!&amp;#039; you&amp;#039;re on disk 2.\n*SAVE AT THE SONG OF NEPHILIM!!! On disk 2 for the same reason as above! Just boot up disk 3 instead and you&amp;#039;re almost finished!\n\nAnd thanks to......alkohol on the Afterdawn forums. Without your\nguide, I couldn&amp;#039;t have played a game I bought more than a year ago!!! (and that was in 2007) and to whomever made the original ripkit for automizing the process.\n\nHope this helps anyone who can&amp;#039;t play DVD9 games!\n\nMy email (nice only please): &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9bf1f4f1f4c4eff3fef5fee3eff7feedfef7dbf3f4eff6faf2f7b5f8f4f6&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nMy favourite website: www.bobii-tv.com (free contests and cheap toys!)\n\nHave fun,\nC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d833f283a65327f4e7cda139a37cf5cf5f2a2994","amp;dn":"Xenosaga+Episode+1+Der+Wille+Zur+Macht+Disk+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d833f283a65327f4e7cda139a37cf5cf5f2a2994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,51,242,131,166,83,39,244,231,205,161,57,163,124,245,207,95,42,41,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
