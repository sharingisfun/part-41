However, contrary to what we could see in the middle of the centuryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½see anno 1950ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½where the films were making a slight effort at developing exposition, here the settings are as basic as possible, usually limited to a bed where one to three protagonists are experimenting with various positions and toys. This is as pornographic as smut can be and the faded black and white look gives it a creepier look, at the exception of one segment where the contrast is so high it becomes almostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½unintentionallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½artistic.\n\nThere are also a few moments where you can see that the actors don't take themselves seriously in front of the camera, which is kind of amusing. However, as a whole, the repetitiveness of the whole ends up getting pretty boring, making Forbidden Movies from the Brothels of Paris mostly a treat for avid connoisseurs and fans of this genre. \n\n\n\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca8e70b23ce2337a3a3c37812cc5f28591c2aa81","amp;dn":"Classic+1920s+porn+-+Forbidden+Movies+from+the+Brothels+of+Paris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca8e70b23ce2337a3a3c37812cc5f28591c2aa81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,142,112,178,60,226,51,122,58,60,55,129,44,197,242,133,145,194,170,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
