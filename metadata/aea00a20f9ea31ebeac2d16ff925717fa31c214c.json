Continuing to draw on electronic influences like synth pop and dubstep, Muse looked to artists like Justice and Skrillex as they sought out new ways to open up their already grandiose symphonic rock sound even further. The album also finds bassist Chris Wolstenholme stepping into the vocal spotlight for the first time on a pair of songs written by him about his personal struggles with alcoholism. Fans worried that the band might be straying away from its bombastic wheelhouse should check out the album's lead single, &quot;Survival,&quot; an epic and determined song proving that it takes a little more than some electronics to snuff out the influence of Queen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aea00a20f9ea31ebeac2d16ff925717fa31c214c","amp;dn":"Muse+-+The+2nd+Law+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aea00a20f9ea31ebeac2d16ff925717fa31c214c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,160,10,32,249,234,49,235,234,194,209,111,249,37,113,127,163,28,33,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
