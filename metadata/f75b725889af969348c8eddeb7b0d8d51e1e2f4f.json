It has been released annually since 1989, and new volumes appear in November at local Target stores (in time for the Christmas season), with proceeds benefiting various charitable organizations. The CD usually generates over $500,000 every year for Minnesota charities. In the last several years, the recordings have sold quickly, disappearing within minutes in many stores.\n\nCities 97 Sampler Vol. 9 (1997)\n\n    Sister Hazel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;All for You&quot;\n    Widespread Panic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Hope in a Hopeless World&quot;\n    Duncan Sheik Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Barely Breathing&quot;\n    Jonny Lang Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Lie to Me&quot;\n    Storyville Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Bitter Rain&quot;\n    Corey Stevens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;It's Over&quot;\n    Ugly Americans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Vulcan Death Grip (Of Love)&quot;\n    Tim Mahoney Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Talk to Me&quot;\n    Chalk Farm Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Lie on Lie&quot;\n    Luther Allison Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Move from the Hood&quot;\n    Abra Moore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Four Leaf Clover&quot;\n    The Honeydogs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Your Blue Door&quot;\n    Semisonic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;FNT&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f75b725889af969348c8eddeb7b0d8d51e1e2f4f","amp;dn":"VA+-+Cities%27+97+Sampler+Volume+9+%281997%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f75b725889af969348c8eddeb7b0d8d51e1e2f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,91,114,88,137,175,150,147,72,200,237,222,183,176,216,213,30,30,47,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
