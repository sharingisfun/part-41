This isn't some pop music where \n\nthe computer does all the work!\n\nThis list is of actually good songs, but is in no way an official cd, \n\njust some great songs put into a cd format. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86052749433dd12931a65484b238e1049e1b6dfa","amp;dn":"Real+Fucking+Music%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86052749433dd12931a65484b238e1049e1b6dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,5,39,73,67,61,209,41,49,166,84,132,178,56,225,4,158,27,109,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
