In mainstream circles, the group is most well known for their early synthpop singles, including the international hits &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Talk Talk&quot;, &quot;It's My Life&quot;, &quot;Such a Shame&quot;, &quot;Dum Dum Girl&quot;, &quot;Life's What You Make It&quot; and &quot;Living in Another World&quot;. However, in the music community they are recognised more for the artistic achievements of their later experimental albums, recognised as forerunners to the post-rock genre.\n\nTalk Talk began as a quartet consisting of Mark Hollis (vocals), Simon Brenner (keyboards), Lee Harris (drums) and Paul Webb (bass). Hollis was the brother of Ed Hollis, manager of Eddie and the Hot Rods, and had started out in a punk band called The Reaction. They were generally associated with the New Wave movement; more specifically, in their early years, they were often compared with Duran Duran, as both bands not only featured a double-barrelled name and a Roxy Music-inspired musical direction, but also a record label (EMI) and producer (Colin Thurston).\n\nTalk Talk's first line-up released a self-titled debut EP in 1982 which was quickly expanded into a full-length album entitled The Party's Over. The band charted in the UK Top 40 with the singles &quot;Talk Talk&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;, both produced by Thurston (who had also produced hits for Duran Duran and Howard Jones).\n\nBrenner left after the 1983 non-LP single &quot;My Foolish Friend&quot;, which was produced by frequent Roxy Music collaborator Rhett Davies. At this point, the band added unofficial fourth member Tim Friese-Greene, who became Talk Talk's keyboard player, producer, and Hollis' frequent writing partner. Although a major contributor to the band's studio output, Friese-Greene did not generally play with the band during live shows or appear in publicity material. Talk Talk stopped playing live in 1986.\n\nHistory Revisited: The Remixes is a 1991 album comprising remixes of hit Talk Talk songs. It followed the successful greatest hits collection Natural History, released the year before. The band itself did not take part in the making of the album and condemned its release; consequently, they sued their former record label EMI for using Talk Talk material without permission\n\nTrack listing\n&quot;Living in Another World - '91&quot; 4:40 \nRemixed by Julian Mendelsohn \n\n&quot;Such a Shame&quot; 5:41 \nRemixed by Gary Miller \n\n&quot;Happiness is Easy (Dub)&quot; 7:02 \nRemixed by Paul Webb and Lee Harris \n\n&quot;Today&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:24 \nRemixed by Gary Miller\n \n&quot;Dum Dum Girl (Spice Remix)&quot; 4:59 \nRemixed by Justin Robertson\n \n&quot;Life's What You Make It&quot; 6:14 \nRemixed by BBG \n\n&quot;Talk Talk&quot; 5:22 \nRemixed by Gary Miller\n \n&quot;It's My Life (Tropical Rainforest Mix)&quot; 5:58 \nRemixed by Dominic Woosey and JJ Montana \n\n&quot;Living in Another World (Curious World Dub Mix)&quot; 7:48 \nRemixed by 4 to the Floor\n \n&quot;Life's What You Make It (The Fluke Remix)&quot; 6:16 \nRemixed by Fluke \n\n\n320KBPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a52c8ee2e7a5b3f866316dcf5a2465f05d0c22c1","amp;dn":"Talk+Talk+-+History+Revisited%3AThe+Remixes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a52c8ee2e7a5b3f866316dcf5a2465f05d0c22c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,44,142,226,231,165,179,248,102,49,109,207,90,36,101,240,93,12,34,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
