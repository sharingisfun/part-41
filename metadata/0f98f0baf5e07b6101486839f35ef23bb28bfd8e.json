Or if the RAF had been defeated in the Battle of Britain? What if the U-Boats had strangled Britain with an impregnable blockade, if Rommel had been triumphant in North Africa or the Germans had beaten the Red Army at Kursk? \n\nThe authors, writing as if these and other world-changing events had really happened, project realistic scenarios based on the true capabilities and circumstances of the opposing forces. Third Reich Victorious is a spirited and terrifying alternate history, and a telling insight into the dramatic possibilities of World War II.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction | Alternative History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f98f0baf5e07b6101486839f35ef23bb28bfd8e","amp;dn":"Third+Reich+Victorious+by+Peter+Tsouras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f98f0baf5e07b6101486839f35ef23bb28bfd8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,152,240,186,245,224,123,97,1,72,104,57,243,94,242,59,178,139,253,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
