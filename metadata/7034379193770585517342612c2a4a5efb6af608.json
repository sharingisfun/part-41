The two teamed up with different supporting musicians in order to give Paul Rodgers freedom to pursue whatever music style he felt like. \n\nUnlike his previous projects in which he wrote or co-wrote most of the material, he relied heavily on outside writers to write songs for the album (Like Phil Collen, Chris Rea, Bryan Adams, etc...). Ironically, the only chart topper of the album, 'Laying Down the Law,' was written by Rodgers himself. The album features notable appearances by David Gilmour, Bryan Adams, Chris Rea and Jim Barber.\n\nAside from the single, the album was received very poorly by the critics and the public which led to disbanding of the band.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;For a Little Ride&quot; (Mark Mangold, Benny Mardones) - 3:54\n    &quot;Miss You in a Heartbeat&quot; (Phil Collen) - 4:32\n    &quot;Stone Cold&quot; (Tamara Champlin/Terry Wilson) - 4:13\n    &quot;Come Save Me (Julianne)&quot; (Charlie Black, Cliff Downs, Austin Roberts) - 4:01\n    &quot;Laying Down the Law&quot; (Rodgers) - 4:22\n    &quot;Nature of the Beast&quot; (Bryan Adams, Jim Vallance) - 3:53\n    &quot;Stone&quot; (Chris Rea) - 5:12\n    &quot;Anything for You&quot; (Steve Diamond, Eric McCusker) - 3:57\n    &quot;Best of My Love&quot; (Jerry Lynn Williams) - 4:36\n    &quot;Tough Love&quot; (Rodgers) - 3:41\n    &quot;Missing You Bad Girl (Rodgers) - 4:42\n\nThe Law\n\n    Paul Rodgers: Vocals, Guitars, Piano\n    Kenney Jones: Drums\n    Jim Barber: Lead Guitars\n\nAdditional Musicians\n\n    John Staehely: Guitar\n    Pino Palladino: Bass\n    David Gilmour: Guitar on &quot;Stone&quot;\n    Chris Rea: Guitar on &quot;Stone&quot;\n    Bryan Adams, Mike Hehir: Guitars\n    Jim barber: Lead Guitars [on most tracks]\n    John Astley, Steve Pigott: Keyboards, Programming\n    Albhy Galuten: Synthesizer\n    George Hawkins: Bass\n    Tom Pool: Drums\n    Joe Lala: Percussion\n    The Memphis Horns: Horns\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7034379193770585517342612c2a4a5efb6af608","amp;dn":"The+Law+-+The+Law+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7034379193770585517342612c2a4a5efb6af608","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,52,55,145,147,119,5,133,81,115,66,97,44,42,74,94,251,106,246,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
