He was born January 15th, 1929. He was assassinated April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was just thirty-nine years old. While Dr. King is primarily remembered as a civil rights leader, he also championed the cause of the poor and organized the Poor PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Campaign to address issues of economic justice. Dr. King was also a fierce critic of US foreign policy and the Vietnam War. We play his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeyond VietnamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ speech, which he delivered at New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Riverside Church on April 4, 1967, as well as his last speech, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Have Been to the Mountain Top,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that he gave on April 3, 1968, the night before he was assassinated.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9879743b60844876c26479bf812949e2927bb10a","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+17+jan+2011+-+Dr.+Martin+Luther+King%2C+Jr.+in+His","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9879743b60844876c26479bf812949e2927bb10a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,121,116,59,96,132,72,118,194,100,121,191,129,41,73,226,146,123,177,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
