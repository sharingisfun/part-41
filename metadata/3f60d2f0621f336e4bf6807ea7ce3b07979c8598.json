One especially fast-growing area of interest is the &quot;experience-driven&quot; or &quot;wellness&quot; vacation, a proactive approach based on the idea that true recreation involves positive engagement: acquiring a new skill or volunteering to share your own expertise; exercising your intellect or extending yourself in some creative, physical, or spiritual way.\n\nIn response to such aspirations, this timely book showcases a broad range of the most life-enriching getaways in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, with something for every taste and every interest. Here are programs dedicated to kayaking lessons, mountain biking, yoga instruction, and more. Perhaps you'd prefer to spend an arts and crafts holiday focused on a creative activity like cooking, painting, or woodworking. Imagine studying French in a Maine village, learning about nutrition at a historic North Carolina spa, or helping rebuild the devastated communities of the Gulf Coast. Weave a Navajo rug; make a film in New York; learn to surf in Mexico; or choose any of scores of other possibilities.\n\nElegantly designed and packed with attractive and fun descriptions, detailed travel information, lists of unique activities, and special sidebars, this unusual resource tells you all you need to know to ensure that your next vacation won't just be time offÃ¢â‚¬â€it will be time well spent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f60d2f0621f336e4bf6807ea7ce3b07979c8598","amp;dn":"The+100+Best+Vacations+to+Enrich+Your+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f60d2f0621f336e4bf6807ea7ce3b07979c8598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,96,210,240,98,31,51,110,75,246,128,126,167,206,59,7,151,156,133,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
