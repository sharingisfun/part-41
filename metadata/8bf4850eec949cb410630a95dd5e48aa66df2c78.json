But they knew that it was worth selling. It was a small bronze disc of exquisite design. So they contacted the archaeologist Harald Meller, offering to sell it to him for ?300,000. \n\nMeller went deep into the criminal underworld and, after a police sting, he got his disc. It depicted the sun, the moon and the stars. This suggested an understanding of the heavens greater than that of the first great civilisations, like Egypt. Could it possibly be real? \n\nAfter exhaustive tests, the disc was declared genuine. Then a team of crack scientists pieced together what it meant. What emerged is a true marvel. \n\nThis disc, it seems, is a Bronze Age Bible, combining an advanced understanding of the stars with some of the most sophisticated religious imagery of the age. In intellectual achievement and also age, it surpasses anything yet found in Egypt or Greece. It seems that civilisation had already dawned in Europe. \n\nNB: The quality is fairly good, although there may be an occasional picture or sound breakup, these should not detract from viewing.\n\nLink to English subtitles\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: DivX 5.11\nVideo Bitrate: 1815 kb/s\nVideo Resolution: 720x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: mp3\nAudio BitRate: 128kb/s VBR 44.1kHz\nRunTime Per Part: 49m 29s\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 689MB\nEncoded by Blaiser47","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf4850eec949cb410630a95dd5e48aa66df2c78","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+Secrets+of+the+Star+Disk+DVB+DivX511-MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf4850eec949cb410630a95dd5e48aa66df2c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,244,133,14,236,148,156,180,16,99,10,149,221,94,72,170,102,223,44,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
