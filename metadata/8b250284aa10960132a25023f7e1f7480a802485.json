This album will always be special for us, as it was the beginning for a group of young guys who became lifelong friends through our music. I had just turned twenty years old when we traveled out to Elektra Studios to record &quot;The Ship&quot; and in many ways, we grew up together over the next few years, traveling around the country in a beat up Chevy van and playing concerts. Not quite as glamorous as sailing the seas on a beautiful boat, but it was, for the most part, an awful lot of fun.\nThe group still manages to get together once a year or so to play and it's still as much fun as it was back in the beginning. Visit us at [...] for information about the band, past and present, including three additional CDs of our music with around 40 previously unreleased cuts that sat untouched for better than 30 years in boxes in a basement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b250284aa10960132a25023f7e1f7480a802485","amp;dn":"The+Ship...A+Contemporary+Folk+Music+Journey%281971%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b250284aa10960132a25023f7e1f7480a802485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,37,2,132,170,16,150,1,50,162,80,35,247,225,247,72,10,128,36,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
