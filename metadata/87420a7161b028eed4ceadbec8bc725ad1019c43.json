The affectionate\ntwiddle he inserts into the theme here is like a conniving wink to an old\nfriend. on Senne Sing Song, his third John Zorn-produced trio album after 1994's\nWho's Bridge (Avant) and 1997's No Idea (DIW), Mengelberg is joined by the\nremarkably responsive rhythm team of bassist Greg Cohen and drummer Ben\nPerowsky. Several Mengelberg &quot;standards&quot; appear (&quot;Reef und Kneebus,&quot;\n&quot;Brozziman&quot;), plodding amiably along at the pianist's by-now-familiar if\nslightly stodgy mid-tempo. The element of surprise comes from the pianist's\nunerring ability to find and follow the right wrong notes; Mengelberg's music\nremains a quintessential example of how recognizable idioms -- from Baroque\ncounterpoint to the Duke-ish left-hand thunks and Monk-ish whole-tone runs --\ncan be extended (and subverted) into something both musically profound and\nprofoundly musical.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87420a7161b028eed4ceadbec8bc725ad1019c43","amp;dn":"Misha+Mengelberg+-+Senne+Sing+Song+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87420a7161b028eed4ceadbec8bc725ad1019c43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,66,10,113,97,176,40,238,212,206,173,190,200,188,114,90,209,1,156,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
