All circulating Maui footage edited and sync'd with the best available audio sources.\r\nThis is the 25 minutes of Rainbow Bridge Jimi Hendrix footage, 20 minutes of outtakes, and the Strange Day On Maui footage (about 10 minutes), all re-synced to the soundboard audio. The songs are full-length, although the film footage is not. The gaps are filled in with Maui footage, 1960s stuff, surfing footage, and Strange Day On Maui footage. The audio is the overdubbed-drums source, the only one available, so the drums are out of sync a bit. It's hardly noticeable though. Hope you all enjoy it.\r\nFootage sources: &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; film (ftbfs: OV 09) (tracks 1,2,5,6,8,9,10,12,16,17,18), &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; single camera out-takes (tracks 9,10,11,13,14,15) &amp; &quot;Strange Days On Maui&quot; film (tracks 3,4,6,7,9,15) [Additional non-concert footage to fill in gaps lifted from the films &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot;, &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;Endless Summer&quot;, &quot;Berkely in the 60's&quot; and &quot;Hawaiian Paradise&quot;] / Audio source: Mono Sbd; 2nd Gen *\r\n[* Due to technical problems the drums were not properly recorded. Mitch Mitchell re-recorded his drum parts in 1971 at Electric Lady Studios. This is the only available complete audio source, hence Mitch will appear out-of-sync at times.]\r\n\r\n01.
