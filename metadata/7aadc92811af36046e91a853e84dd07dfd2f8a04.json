Cultures clash and sparks fly as she pits her blunt antiBritish, profeminist views against his oldschool attitudes and witheringly polite putdowns. It is the American Revolution and the battle of the sexes all rolled into one rollicking comedy. Guest stars include Penelope Keith, Tony Selby, and Joyce Carey.\n\n\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1: The Bait\nSeason 1, Episode 2: The Housekeeping\nSeason 1, Episode 3: Dorothy's Electrician\nSeason 1, Episode 4: The Patient\nSeason 1, Episode 5: The Romance\nSeason 1, Episode 6: Robert's Mother\n\nSeason 2, Episode 0: A Loving Christmas\nSeason 2, Episode 1: The Reluctant Traveller\nSeason 2, Episode 2: The Burglary\nSeason 2, Episode 3: The Rubbish\nSeason 2, Episode 4: The Honeymoon\nSeason 2, Episode 5: Robert's Record Player\nSeason 2, Episode 6: The Guests\nSeason 2, Episode 7: The Cleaning Ladies\n\nSeason 3, Episode 1: The Invitation\nSeason 3, Episode 2: The Freezer\nSeason 3, Episode 3: The Pet\nSeason 3, Episode 4: The TakeOver Bid\nSeason 3, Episode 5: The Virus\nSeason 3, Episode 6: The Critic\nSeason 3, Episode 7: The Picnic\nSeason 3, Episode 8: The Politicians\n\nSeason 4, Episode 1: The Club\nSeason 4, Episode 2: The Clergy\nSeason 4, Episode 3: The Salesman\nSeason 4, Episode 4: The Visiting Scots\nSeason 4, Episode 5: The Silence\nSeason 4, Episode 6: The RollsRoyce\nSeason 4, Episode 7: The Friendly Aristocrats\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aadc92811af36046e91a853e84dd07dfd2f8a04","amp;dn":"Two%5C%27s+Company+%281975+BBC+Comedy%29+Elaine+Stritch%2C+Donald+Sinden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aadc92811af36046e91a853e84dd07dfd2f8a04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,173,201,40,17,175,54,4,110,145,168,83,232,77,208,125,253,47,138,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
