Cross-referenced to the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine, and thoroughly illustrated, it is the ideal introduction to the basic medical sciences for junior medical students, and a perfect revision guide for senior students.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e65e3f834f650808268235b9e8937afab269fed","amp;dn":"Oxford+Handbook+of+Medical+Sciences%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e65e3f834f650808268235b9e8937afab269fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,101,227,248,52,246,80,128,130,104,35,91,158,137,55,175,171,38,159,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
