Using this remarkable cache of smuggled correspondence, Orlando Figes tells the tale of two incredible people who, swept along in the very worst of times, kept their devotion alive.\nOrlando Figes was granted exclusive access to the thousands of letters between Lev and Sveta that form the foundation of Just Send Me Word, and he was able to interview the couple in person, then in their nineties. These real-time and largely uncensored letters form the largest cache of Gulag letters ever found.\nGenre: Non Fiction , Memoirs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56b9a1d486c2a8e923138a42aafa508b9a7423ce","amp;dn":"Just+Send+Me+Word+A+True+Story+of+Love+and+Survival+in+the+Gulag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56b9a1d486c2a8e923138a42aafa508b9a7423ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,185,161,212,134,194,168,233,35,19,138,66,170,250,80,139,154,116,35,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
