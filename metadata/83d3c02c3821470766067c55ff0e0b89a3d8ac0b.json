It was released on July 27, 1984 through the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on November 5, 1987 and was most recently certified 5x platinum on June 9, 2003. Ride the Lightning is considered a classic thrash metal album by fans, critics and band members themselves and is considered one of the greatest metal albums of all time.\n\nRide the Lightning contains the speed of Kill 'Em All on songs like &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot; and &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot;, but also contains the first of Metallica's longer, more intricate tracks, such as &quot;Fade to Black&quot; and the nearly 9-minute closing instrumental &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;. It was the last Metallica album to credit former lead guitarist, Dave Mustaine.\n\nThe album was listed at number 3 on a list compiled by metal-rules.com of the Top 100 Metal Albums of All Time and #5 by IGN Music on the Top 25 Metal Albums.\n\nQ magazine (Summer/01, p. 127) - 5 stars out of 5 - &quot;Reaffirms their status as the pre-eminent metal band of the modern era....They broke with the conventions of thrash metal to record the genre's first power ballad in 'Fade to Black'.&quot;\n\nKerrang! (p. 50) - &quot;[The album included] melody, maturity and musical intelligence. It was these traits which helped them broaden metal's scope.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. Fight Fire with Fire 4:45\n2.
