I came to find that it was not natively present in the game's soundtrack files, which were fortunately lossless, and so I used them for the mix in this torrent. This mix also uses a reprise of a portion of the song found in the game's music files unlike the official soundtrack version. I'm pretty pleased with the results.\nBefore compiling &quot;Portal - The Definitive Lossless Soundtrack Collection&quot;, I looked for pieces in the games that weren't included on the official soundtrack and I couldn't find any. Soon after release, I watched a Portal 2 YouTube video and, sure enough, it turns out there was something I liked that I missed. Called &quot;Ricochet&quot; in the game files, the track is a somewhat dynamically-generated 10-measure loop. I came to find another unofficial mix effort for this track, and besides the fact that it wasn't lossless, it really wasn't an enjoyable listen the way the track was mixed in my opinion. So I put my own mix of it together, trying to make it as enjoyable a listen as possible and loosely basing it on the way it comes out in-game. It is mixed to 24 bits to allow full definition of the looped audio and headroom for the mixing. I'm fairly pleased with the results.\nTagging may not conform to any standard, common or otherwise.\nReplayGain values are omitted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ebceb7b5cfc92a1801e3c07e23089da65fc99ad","amp;dn":"Portal+-+The+Definitive+Lossless+Soundtrack+Collection+DLC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ebceb7b5cfc92a1801e3c07e23089da65fc99ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,188,235,123,92,252,146,161,128,30,60,7,226,48,137,218,101,252,153,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
