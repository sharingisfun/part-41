It will open to the initial eeePC boot screen that requires you to accept the ASUS EULA.  \n\nTo Build it yourself:\n1.Download the eeePC SDK (available here http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=215613)\n2.Download the eeePC restore image (also available above)\n3.Install the SDK on a blank hard drive OR into a virtual machine (I used the VM)\n4.Follow the instructions in the SDK manual page 35-36\n5.Copy the resultant files to wherever you plan on using the VM\n6.Open and enjoy\n\nTo avoid steps 1 ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? 5, download my torrent.  That also saves over 1 gig of download time.\n\nI used Vmware Player available for free at www.vmware.com.  There are several other free packages that should also open it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c37521aad4eae874e5741eabd465c2c07eef83c9","amp;dn":"Virtual+eee+PC.+ASUS+eee+PC+distro+installed+in+VM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c37521aad4eae874e5741eabd465c2c07eef83c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,117,33,170,212,234,232,116,229,116,30,171,212,101,194,192,126,239,131,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
