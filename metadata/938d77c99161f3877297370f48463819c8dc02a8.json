You'll face dozens of dangerous enemies while you find new and powerful spells, and learn helpful perks in your quest to overcome this deadly test.\n\nUpdate 14 changelog:\n- All weapons have now a secondary fire mode (Right click by default). It's usually a stronger variation of the attack, or a special shot that induces state effects.\n- Some changes that should improve performance, specially on bigger levels. This may have caused some bugs here and there, please report if you find anything.\n- A small improvement in water rendering performance on high levels of detail.\n- Minimap icons are now properly shown when Rotate map is enabled.\n- Added models, sounds and effects for the weapons added in the last update\n- Bosses can now be poisoned.\n- Increased poison damage over time\n- Shrines won't be activated if you can't pay the price, instead of punishing you.\n- Reduced number of Kobolds spawned by Poloko.\n- Drops, weapons, etc shouldn't slide that much, so they won't fall into lava in Challenge rooms.\n- Shielded Skeletons aren't allowed to be Green champions.\n- Reduced a bit the damage hitbox for Shielded skeletons.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it!         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/308420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/308420&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:938d77c99161f3877297370f48463819c8dc02a8","amp;dn":"Ziggurat+%28Update+14%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"938d77c99161f3877297370f48463819c8dc02a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,141,119,201,145,97,243,135,114,151,55,15,72,70,56,25,200,220,2,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
