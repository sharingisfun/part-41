It was reissued in 1989 with seven &quot;bonus&quot; tracks, including cover versions and B-sides. &quot;South Africa&quot; /&quot;John&quot; was a single Ian had written and recorded with guitarist Bernie Marsden.\n\nAlthough the album was generally accepted by Gillan's staunch UK following it failed to achieve the chart success of Glory Road or Future Shock, peaking at No. 17 in the UK chart.\n\nGillan disbanded when Ian Gillan became the singer of Black Sabbath in 1983 for only one album and tour, and shortly thereafter joined the reformed Deep Purple in 1984.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n    &quot;What's The Matter&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.31) (Gillan/McCoy/Gers)\n    &quot;Bluesy Blue Sea&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.51) (Gillan/Gers)\n    &quot;Caught In A Trap&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.35)\n    &quot;Long Gone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.57)\n    &quot;Driving Me Wild&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.01)\n    &quot;Demon Driver&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (7.16)\n    &quot;Living A Lie&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.25)\n    &quot;You're So Right&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (2.55) (Gillan/McCoy)\n    &quot;Living For The City&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.28) (Wonder)\n    &quot;Demon Driver (reprise)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (0.44)\n    &quot;Breaking Chains&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.28) (Gillan/Gers)\n    &quot;Fiji&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (5.21) (Gillan / McCoy)\n    &quot;Purple Sky&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.24) (Gillan/McCoy)\n    &quot;South Africa&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.03) (Marsden)\n    &quot;John&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.44) (Gillan)\n    &quot;South Africa&quot; (12&quot; extended version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (7.18) (Bernie Marsden)\n    &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (3.26) (John Lennon, Paul McCartney)*\n    &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (4.08) (Burnett)*\n\n\n    Ian Gillan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals, Harmonica\n    Janick Gers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar\n    Colin Towns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Keyboards\n    John McCoy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass guitar\n    Mick Underwood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:965c33bc4f5696e1e0515f6794ecf360f20086dd","amp;dn":"Gillan+-+Magic+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"965c33bc4f5696e1e0515f6794ecf360f20086dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,92,51,188,79,86,150,225,224,81,95,103,148,236,243,96,242,0,134,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
