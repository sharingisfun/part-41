The book consolidates the most recent research on current technologies, concepts, and commercial developments in various types of widely used biofuels and integrated biorefineries, across the disciplines of biochemistry, biotechnology, phytology, and microbiology. All the chapters in the book are derived from international scientific experts in their respective research areas. They provide you with clear and concise information on both standard and more recent bioenergy production methods, including hydrolysis and microbial fermentation. Chapters are also designed to facilitate early stage researchers, and enables you to easily grasp the concepts, methodologies and application of bioenergy technologies. Each chapter in the book describes the merits and drawbacks of each technology as well as its usefulness. The book provides information on recent approaches to graduates, post-graduates, researchers and practitioners studying and working in field of the bioenergy. It is an invaluable information resource on biomass-based biofuels for fundamental and applied research, catering to researchers in the areas of bio-hydrogen, bioethanol, bio-methane and biorefineries, and the use of microbial processes in the conversion of biomass into biofuels. It reviews all existing and promising technologies for production of advanced biofuels in addition to bioenergy policies and research funding. It features cutting-edge research concepts for biofuels production using biological and biochemical routes, including microbial fuel cells. It includes production methods and conversion processes for all types of biofuels, including bioethanol and biohydrogen, and outlines the pros and cons of each.\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Vijai Kumar Gupta is the Assistant Professor of Biotechnology, MITS University of India. Currently he is working as Research Scientist, at National University of Ireland, Galway. Dr. Gupta's present work is focused on &quot;The development and optimization of novel Enzyme-based bioconversion systems for biorefining and bioenergy&quot;. He has completed his Ph.D. in Microbiology with specialization in Applied Mycology and Molecular Plant Pathology from Dr. R.M.L. Avadh University, Faizabad, UP, India. He has been honoured with several awards in his career including the prestigious Indian ICAR Senior Research Fellowship and Indian Young Scientist Award 2009, 2011 &amp; Gold Medal Award-2009 for his advance research achievements in the field of Fungal Genetics &amp; Biology.\nDr. Maria G. Tuohy is the Head of the Molecular Glycobiotechnology Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, School of Natural Sciences, NUI Galway which has developed a strong track record in Glycobiotechnology and Enzyme Biotechnology. She has more than 20 years experience in the molecular biochemistry, genetics and biotechnology of fungi, with a special interest in thermophilic ascomycetes and the characterization of these fungi as cell factories for protein production, including novel thermostable enzymes/enzyme systems. Dr. Tuohy and her group have developed patented enzyme-based technologies for key bioenergy and biorefinery applications from terrestrial and marine biomass and wastes, including 3rd generation feedstocks.\nDr. John (Jack) Saddler is the endowed Professor of Forest Products Biotechnology / Bioenergy (originally an NSERC Industry Chair) and also the former Dean, Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia. Professor Saddler has been involved, for more than 30 years, in various national and international organizations that have advanced the global understanding of how woody biomass can be converted to useful fuels and chemicals. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Canada's highest recognition for scientists, and he has received many other awards for contributions to the field of &quot;Biotechnology for fuels and Chemicals&quot;.\n\nCONTENTS\n1.
