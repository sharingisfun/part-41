Eclipse\na) Skyscrapers\nb) Sooner or later\n2. Mesentery\n3. The raven (including &quot;Theme for James Marshall&quot;)\n4. Early bell's voice\n\nBand:\nLorenz KÃƒÂ¶hler - lead vocals\nWolfgang Kracht - bass, back vocals\nJochen Petersen - acoustic &amp; electric guitars, alto &amp; tenor saxes, flute, clarinet, back vocals\nBernd Schroder - drums, percussion\nManfred Schulz - guitar, lead vocals (4), back vocals\nWulf-Dieter Struntz - organ, piano\n\nIKARUS played progressive rock that sometimes was in the vein of VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR. The sound is dominated by emphasis on guitar and organ interplay, but the use of flute, saxophone and clarinet add more color to their compositions. Far from perfect, but listenable enough for fans\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb7b03408c104c91b369567f8f5b8c5e2b12bde5","amp;dn":"Ikarus+-+Ikarus+%281971%2F1995%29+%28mp3%40320%2BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb7b03408c104c91b369567f8f5b8c5e2b12bde5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,123,3,64,140,16,76,145,179,105,86,127,143,91,140,94,43,18,189,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
