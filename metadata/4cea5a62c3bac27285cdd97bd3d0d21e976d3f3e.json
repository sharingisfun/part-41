The concert was also released as a 2 disc DVD. The title derives from the fact that it was the last concert in San Francisco's Winterland Arena, which was shut down shortly thereafter. The Dead celebrated the Closing as an approximately five hour long party (complete with breakfast with the audience at dawn) and invited some guests including guitarist John Cipollina of Quicksilver Messenger Service and Ken Kesey as well as actor Dan Aykroyd who provided the midnight countdown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cea5a62c3bac27285cdd97bd3d0d21e976d3f3e","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-The+Closing+Of+Winterland+%5Bmp3-vbr-2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cea5a62c3bac27285cdd97bd3d0d21e976d3f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,234,90,98,195,186,194,114,133,205,217,123,211,208,210,30,151,109,63,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
