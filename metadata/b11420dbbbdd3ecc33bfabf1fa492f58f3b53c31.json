Captain John &quot;Black Jack&quot; GearyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ship the Meron was destroyed but he escaped in a pod in suspended animation; only to wake up a hundred years later to learn he is a legend and that the war continues unabated. The Alliance sends a fleet into the heart of Syndic Space, but due to a series of dreadful circumstances, Jack becomes the commander.\n\nAfter some fierce battles, the fleet is ready to use Jump Points to return to Alliance space. Jack and a few others learned the Syndicate worlds were manipulated into going to war by a mysterious race of aliens who want the two combatant groups to destroy one another. It is urgent that Jack and his crew return home because they possess the Syndic hypernet key that can be used as a weapon. While fighting and eluding the Syndic fleets, Jack tries to convince those who have admired him that he dos not want to be the leader of the Alliance and explains to his supporters he is a warrior not a politician.\n\nThis exhilarating action packed outer space military thriller will remind the audience of the battles in Star Wars. Jack is terrific as he realizes his past glory can carry him so far with his demi-god celebrity status, but he caught in a conundrum of what his fame means to the Alliance and what he has learned while in Syndric Space about the true enemy. Many believe he is the only one who can end the hundred year war though he has his doubts as to what should be done next.\n\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11420dbbbdd3ecc33bfabf1fa492f58f3b53c31","amp;dn":"Jack+Campbell+-+The+Lost+Fleet+Relentless+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11420dbbbdd3ecc33bfabf1fa492f58f3b53c31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,20,32,219,187,221,62,204,51,191,171,241,250,73,47,88,243,181,60,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
