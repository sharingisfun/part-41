Influenced early in life by circus and vaudeville performers who passed through his family's hotel in Nashville, Dave was exposed to many styles of performance and in 1885 he met banjo player Joel Davidson and became captivated by the instrument.  By the 1890s, Dave was entertaining stagecoach passengers with banjo tunes and comic antics from a homemade stage on the roof of the family's barn. \n\nUncle Dave Macon was one of the first country stars to record, the first star of the Grand Ole Opry, and one of the first members elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nPossibly one of the finest sets out.  If you want to really understand the depth of early country music, then you must have this set.  Macon had all the styles and showmanship that influenced everyone from Charlie Poole to Bill Monroe.  Every single song that was ever issued by Macon is contained on this set and the book is an incredible read. Most recommended! ~ Ben Dewberry\n\nThis is the best box set for the hardcore Uncle Dave Macon fan.  If you want to hear live tracks you have never had access to, and if you want to find out what the older tracks that were only released on 78 rpm are all about, you need this box!  The book is wonderful with newly found photos and a very detailed discography of the recordings! Probably, a little too rich for the casual fan. ~ M. Bailey\n\nPlease see for more information - Schon55 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Dave_Macon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Dave_Macon&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUncle Dave Macon - Keep My Skillet Good &amp; Greasy CD 6 of 6\n01  For Goodness Sakes Don't Say I Told You\n02  We Need A Change In Business All Around\n03  Susie Lee\n04  Mister Johnson\n05  Farm Relief\n06  Uncle Dave's Travels, Part 3 (In And Around Nashville)\n07  Since Baby's Learned To Talk\n08  Uncle Dave's Travels, Part 4 (Visit At The Old Maid's)\n09  Over The Mountain\n10  Hush Little Baby Don't You Cry\n11  Uncle Dave's Travels, Part 1 (Misery In Arkansas)\n12  Uncle Dave's Travels, Part 2 (Around Louisville, KY)\n13  Tennessee Red Fox Chase\n14  The Wreck Of The Tennessee Gravy Train\n15  Oh Baby, You Done Me Wrong\n16  She's Got The Money Too\n17  Oh Lovin' Babe\n18  Mysteries Of The World\n19  Come On Buddie, Don't You Want To Go\n20  Go On, Nora Lee\n21  Was You There When They Took My Lord Away\n22  Thank God For Everything\n23  When The Train Comes Along\n24  Tennessee Tornado\n25  Don't Get Weary Children\n26  He's Up With The Angels Now","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc8be4c159046191641e98f3d480b52a0e004f5","amp;dn":"Uncle+Dave+Macon+-+Keep+My+Skillet+Good+%26+Greasy+CD+6+of+6+%281979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cc8be4c159046191641e98f3d480b52a0e004f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,200,190,76,21,144,70,25,22,65,233,143,61,72,11,82,160,224,4,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
