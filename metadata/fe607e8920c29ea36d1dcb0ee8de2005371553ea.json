W. creates a surreal musical landscape.\r\nTheir music is full of passion and the experienced listener can spot influences ranging from soul to progressive, from hard rock to pop.\r\nPanosâ€™ guitars create an atmosphere of celebration and and the voice of Echo Tattoo dances on the fine line between raw power and lyricism.\r\nThe guests on this album are some of the most important performers of the Greek Alternative Scene: Argy of â€œNightstalkerâ€, Tanya L of Liquidust and the full cast of Bliss (Vags, Chris, Stef) unite their voices for â€œCAVEMANâ€ while Alex K of â€œthe Earthboundâ€ and â€œThe Last Driveâ€ leaves his mark on â€œAPOCALYPSEâ€.\r\nIn these times of cynicism, Echo Tattoo keep talking for humans rights, against the vicious cycle of blind money making and the only freedom we have left that presents itself in love and empathy.\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/eXHR4jG.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
