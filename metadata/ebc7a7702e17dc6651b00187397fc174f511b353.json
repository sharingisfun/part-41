Enemy fatalities numbered between 500 and 800.\n\nThe Battle of Long Tan reveals how the heroic deeds of the young Australian and New Zealand soldiers, guided by a savvy band of commanders, re-wrote the military manual. It recreates this momentous, yet often forgotten, battle regarded as one of the most pivotal, shocking, dramatic and bravura engagements, not only of the Vietnam War, but in world military history.\n\nThis unique story will be told through dramatic scene recreations and exclusive interviews with the seven key Commanders from the Battle, as well as their soldiers, members of the former Vietnamese enemy and family members of those who lost their lives. The 90 min documentary will also utilise a number of special effects to help recreate the atmosphere of the battle, including 3D animated maps.\n\nFilming takes place in a number of locations across Australia, New Zealand and in Vietnam and features rare interviews with the seven surviving commanders who fought the frontline at Long Tan.\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nRecorded 11 November 2007\n16:9 standard PAL definition XviD video\n2ch MP3 audio\n\nRecorded and encoded by Kat Cassidy&amp;#039;s Recording Team and uploaded exclusively to Diwana.
