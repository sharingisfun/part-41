According to Julia Cameron, when we allow our creative spirit to serve as our compass, we discover that the art we have always longed to create is suddenly within our grasp.\n\nIn The Creative Life, Cameron shows readers how to use their creative hearts and minds to cultivate lives that nourish and sustain their art. Through beautifully drawn scenes from her own life, as well as the lives of the many artists around her, Cameron reveals that creativity flourishes during the quiet pauses in our lives-and that it is only when we allow ourselves to slow down and savor life that we discover ways to depict it sensitively and poetically in our art. By opening the curtain on her own life and the lives of the artists who surround her, Cameron reveals a world rich with creative possibility.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e8e779bc91eec1de1b9eeab2378c7d6e508799","amp;dn":"Julia+Cameron+%3A+The+Creative+Life_+True+Tales+of+Inspiration+_20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e8e779bc91eec1de1b9eeab2378c7d6e508799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,232,231,121,188,145,238,193,222,27,158,234,178,55,140,125,110,80,135,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
