When she isn't writing, reading, listening to music or watching more TV than is healthy, Lindsey likes to wear shoes, shop for shoes and judge the shoes of others. She loves living in New York but misses Sherbert Fountains, London and drinking Gin &amp; Elderflower cocktails with her friends. Not necessarily in that order.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de29e43aa06fe13259311e422f2f94575ad6725","amp;dn":"Lindsey+Kelk+Books%2CMobi%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de29e43aa06fe13259311e422f2f94575ad6725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,226,158,67,170,6,254,19,37,147,17,228,34,242,249,69,117,173,103,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
