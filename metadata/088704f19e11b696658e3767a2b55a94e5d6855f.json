Upon its release, The Blueprint was rated as Vibe Magazine's &quot;Best Album of the year&quot;, and even received a 5 mic (out of 5) rating from The Source (a distinction reserved for hip hop classics). Pitchfork Media named it the 2nd best album of 2000-2004. The popularity and commercial success of the album established Kanye West and Just Blaze as two of hip-hopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most celebrated producers. Furthermore, The Blueprint signaled a major stylistic shift in hip-hop production towards a more Soulcentric and sample-reliant sound, creating a number of imitators who attempted to emulate the album's atmospheric style. Prior to The Blueprint, mainstream hip-hop producers had largely eschewed music sampling in favor of the keyboard-driven Timbaland sound (characterized by a shifting, syncopated rhythm, similar to samba or jungle music), due to the financial and legal issues associated with copyright laws. The Blueprint, however, revived musical sampling as a common practice in hip hop music and dislodged the digital keyboard-driven production style as the dominant sound in hip-hop music.[26] Kanye West would later incorporate some of the production and sampling techniques he used on this album into his own solo albums. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;One of the greatest poets ever to pick up a mic released his magnum opus in 2001. One retirement and one un-retirement later, it's still his finest hour.\n\nBonus tracks\nAs with Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter, Jay-Z put two hidden bonus tracks at the end of the final track. &quot;Blueprint (Momma Loves Me)&quot; is 3:41 by itself. Twenty-five seconds of silence follows after and the bonus track &quot;Breathe Easy (Lyrical Exercise)&quot; begins. That song fades and is immediately followed by &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls (Part 2).&quot; It is reported that the latter song features uncredited vocals by Michael Jackson. The final track as a whole is 12:07. On the iTunes Store, however, these bonus tracks are released as separate tracks, thus making the album 15 tracks long.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:088704f19e11b696658e3767a2b55a94e5d6855f","amp;dn":"Jay-Z%2F+2001+The+Blueprint++%28320Kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"088704f19e11b696658e3767a2b55a94e5d6855f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,135,4,241,158,17,182,150,101,142,55,103,162,181,90,148,229,214,133,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
