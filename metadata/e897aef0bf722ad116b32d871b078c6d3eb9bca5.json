Born with a natural genius for the game, Botham began breaking records with bat and ball from a young age and soon became the man English cricket expected most from. After a troubled period as captain, Botham rose once again to become a national hero with his display in the Miracle Ashes of 1981. But, with his confrontational nature and wild streak, he began regularly making the wrong kind of headlines. With accusations of drink and drugs, affairs and ball-tampering, he became hounded by the tabloid pack, never sure whether they wanted him to triumph or implode. Now a knight and just as famous for his tireless charity work, Beefy gives us the definitive story of his never-dull life and times in his own no-nonsense words.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e897aef0bf722ad116b32d871b078c6d3eb9bca5","amp;dn":"Head+On+Botham+-+The+Autobiography+-+Ian+Botham.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e897aef0bf722ad116b32d871b078c6d3eb9bca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,151,174,240,191,114,42,209,22,179,45,135,27,7,140,109,62,185,188,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
