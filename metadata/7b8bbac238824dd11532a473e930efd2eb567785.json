No need to say that i was very impressed. Especially the version they played of WTTM (drums on the end) really impressed me. So i was quite disappointed to see, that this track was not included on the DSOT live album. So i bought this one. ItÃ’â€˜s a limited edition of 1000 copies. You get the transfer of #435. Try to get all the others. They maybe different.\nIt is recorded in oslo, norway on 1988-08-02.\nSQ is 6-7/10 for a 1988 recording i would say. Unfortunately there is a guy near the taper who is very proud to know most of the song titles. At least gilmour and the audience seem to have been in a fine mood that night.\nTransfer Lineage:\nDirect Driven Turntable, equipped with a Ortophon OM 10 Super cartridge mounted properly (with E.
