And by &quot;it&quot; we of course mean the highly-anticipated co-op update for the Far Cry 4 Map Editor. With the latest update, all of those awesome maps you've been playing and creating can be played in either single-player or with a friend. It's a gamechanger to be sure, and we know it's something fans have been asking for. \n\nBelow you will find answers to a few of the most common questions, as well as complete patch notes for this update: \n\nCo-Op Map Editor FAQ's\nAll maps will be playable in co-op and in single player mode. \nMap creators will be able to place two spawn points: The first one will spawn Player One, while the second one will spawn Player Two. \nIf only player spawn point is present on the map, both players will spawn at the same location. \nIn the Quick Play menu you can quickplay top rated maps, random maps, and host a co-op game.\n\n\nNew In-Game Editor [IGE] Features:\nConsoles: Lock/Unlock camera function. This is available when using the &quot;Select&quot; tool. \nOcclusion Mesh Helper: When you place or move an object, a gray box will display the occlusion mesh. This option can be enabled/disabled in the &quot;Editor&quot; settings. \n5 new Ally Rebel archetypes.\nImport Bug Fixes\nFixed an issue where Snow was deactivated when restarting a map while in the Map Editor. \nFixed an issue where the Vista and Snow did not appear once the map was published. \nAnimals should now properly exit open gates. \nFixed an issue that resulted in rotation not working for the spawners of wave 2 and 5, as well as for the ambient spawners. \nWave trigger settings should no longer reset to the default value when opening the map. \nThe healing syringe should now display the correct value after a Player has restrated the mission. \nStatic vehicles no longer count towards the AI budget. \nFixed an issue that would cause the Map Editor to crash while using the Bumb tool. \nPC: Fixed the &quot;Copy to Clipboard&quot; function. Map creators can now copy and paste objects from one map to another. \nPC: Map searches start as soon as a letter is entered rather than after pressing enter.\nCo-Op\nIntegrated Outpost Master in Co-Op \nFixed various client connectivity issues \nFixed various Host/Client Replication issues.\nLoad and Save Files\nFixed various checkpoint placement issues\nVehicles\nFixed various issues with vehicle placements\nMatchmaking and PvP\nVarious fixed with matchmaking stability and PvP \nFixed insonsistencies with the XP in the load-out menu\nGameplay\nFixed various spawning issues\nPlease note that patch versions vary by platform.
