Building useful things is your only hope for survival. Use your wit and the hi-tech tools salvaged from the ship-wreck.\r\n\r\nWith a bit of luck and a lot of work, you can win the fight over the environment. Develop your tech, upgrade your suit and survive in places no human has set foot before. Find out about the strange monuments shining on the horizon, explore the lairs of unknown beasts and discover places with rare materials, all in the pursuit of building a spaceship that will take you to other planets.\r\n\r\nIt would be a shame to get stuck in one place. Build a massive, self-sufficient planet-crawler, pack all your things and head on the road, roaming the world like a true Planet Nomad","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97598d3cbb8641b1546a57f93fe4cdb9c67ec7a2","amp;dn":"Planet+Nomads+Editor+v1.0.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97598d3cbb8641b1546a57f93fe4cdb9c67ec7a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,89,141,60,187,134,65,177,84,106,87,249,63,228,205,185,198,126,199,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
