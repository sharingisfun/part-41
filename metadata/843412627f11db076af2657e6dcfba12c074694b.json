It \nis a sister publication to Fortean Times. It has no connection to the fetish \npublication also known as &quot;Bizarre&quot; published between 1946-1959. The magazine \nhas a wide variety of features and articles which include unusual news events \nfrom around the world, drug usage, different types of fetishistic and deviant \nbehavior, interviews with famous counterculture figures and showcases of cult \ndirectors, musicians and authors. Bizarre has also covered legislation regarding \nsex offences and civil liberties, along with issues like censorship and human \nrights abuses, both domestically and abroad. It has also started a campaign to \nraise awareness of prejudice towards subcultures following the murder of Sophie \nLancaster. From the start the publication had much in common with more mainstream \nlad's mags, typically featuring a semi-nude model on the front cover, nude \nphotography in special sealed 'x rated' sections inside, and frequent reviews of \nweird gadgets, films, music, and websites. They regularly cover art, gay culture, \nthe avant-garde and the Cinema of Transgression in their art and music reviews.\n\nEnglish | 132 pages | HQ PDF | 111.00 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:843412627f11db076af2657e6dcfba12c074694b","amp;dn":"Bizarre+Magazine+UK+April+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"843412627f11db076af2657e6dcfba12c074694b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,52,18,98,127,17,219,7,106,242,101,126,109,207,186,18,192,116,105,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
