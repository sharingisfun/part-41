So far only the program package has been moved to trash, leaving any appendant files untouched, that have been spread all over the system. To delete these files, one has to manually locate them, which is extremely time consuming, and most people renounce to install software for a quick test.\n\nAccording to a poll at MacTechNews.de-Forum, users install 2 to 3 applications a week, to give it a trial. That means about 2 to 10 megabytes of useless data every week remaining without CleanApp. Now CleanApp helps you to keep track of these files, so your system doesn't clutter anymore.\n\nCleanApp requires a Mac with Mac OS X 10.4.11 Tiger, 10.5 Leopard, 10.6 Snow Leopard, 10.7 Lion or 10.8 Mountain Lion.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.syniumsoftware.com/cleanapp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.syniumsoftware.com/cleanapp/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:234a3e5fed8ffe6ba706ff12d55cd755e3ffc99d","amp;dn":"CleanApp+3.4.12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"234a3e5fed8ffe6ba706ff12d55cd755e3ffc99d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,74,62,95,237,143,254,107,167,6,255,18,213,92,215,85,227,255,201,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
