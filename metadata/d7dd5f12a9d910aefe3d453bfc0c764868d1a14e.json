Grier, Andrew S. Rivkin\nGreenwood Guides to the Universe\nGreenwood, ABC-CLIO | 2010 | ISBN: 0313344302 | 228 pages | PDF \n\nThis volume in the Greenwood Guides to the Universe series covers the inner planetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Thematic chapters discuss all of the many areas of astronomical research surrounding each subject, providing readers with the most up-to-date understanding of current knowledge and the ways in which it has been obtained.\n\nIntended for use in secondary education, this volume eschews the conventional listing of the numerical data associated with astrophysical texts. Instead, the focus is on explaining processes of planetary formation and change. Grier (research associate, Planetary Science Inst.) and Rivkin (Asteroids, Comets, and Dwarf Planets in this series) break these processes down into 13 thematic chapters, devoting each to a major concept like plate tectonics, magnetospheres, or atmospheres.\nMade up largely of engaging text arranged logically with subheadings, chapters are occasionally punctuated by monochromatic illustrations or informational sidebars. Each is followed by further reading lists.\nA suitable subject primer for high schoolers and lay readers.\n\n\nContents\nSeries Foreword\nPreface\nAcknowledgments\n1 Introduction\n2 Cosmic Collisions: Cratering\n3 Inner Fire: Volcanic Processes\n4 Breaking Point: Tectonic Processes\n5 Winds of Change: Atmospheric Processes\n6 Rocks as Clocks: Radiometric Processes\n7 Triple Point: Hydrologic Processes\n8 Planetary Shield: Magnetospheric Processes\n9 The Moon: Planetary Rosetta Stone\n10 Mercury: Chemical Connections\n11 Venus: Pressure Cooker\n12 Mars: World of Dust and Wind\n13 The Earth: Planet at Our Feet\nAppendix: Planetary Data Tables\nGlossary\nBibliography\nIndex\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7dd5f12a9d910aefe3d453bfc0c764868d1a14e","amp;dn":"Guide+to+the+Universe+-+Inner+Planets+%282010%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7dd5f12a9d910aefe3d453bfc0c764868d1a14e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,221,95,18,169,217,16,174,254,61,69,59,252,12,118,72,104,209,161,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
