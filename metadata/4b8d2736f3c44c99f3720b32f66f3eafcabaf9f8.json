It illustrates how the organizational, data integrity, and extensibility properties of relational databases are best utilized when working with chemical information.\r\n\r\nThe author facilitates an understanding of existing relational database schemas and shows how to design new schemas that contain tables of data and chemical structures. By using database extension cartridges, he provides methods to properly store and search chemical structures. He explains how to download and install a fully functioning database using free, open-source chemical extension cartridges within PostgreSQL. The author also discusses how to access a database on a computer network using both new and existing applications.\r\n\r\nThrough examples of good database design, this book shows you that relational databases are the best way to store, search, and operate on chemical information","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b8d2736f3c44c99f3720b32f66f3eafcabaf9f8","amp;dn":"Design+and+Use+of+Relational+Databases+in+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b8d2736f3c44c99f3720b32f66f3eafcabaf9f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,141,39,54,243,196,76,153,243,114,11,50,246,111,62,175,202,186,249,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
