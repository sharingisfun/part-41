The struggle lasted all day in the longest and bloodiest battle of the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485). With the arrival of Yorkist reinforcements under the Duke of Norfolk, the Lancastrian line eventually broke and their troops fled, many being caught and slaughtered in the death trap known as Ã¢â‚¬ËœBloody MeadowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Christopher Gravett examines the campaign that marked the resurgence of the Yorkist cause and established Edward IV as king","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54d637a34eeeb4d80794e2c6c71f7fed4c08ca8","amp;dn":"Towton+1461%3A+England%27s+Bloodiest+Battle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54d637a34eeeb4d80794e2c6c71f7fed4c08ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,77,99,122,52,238,235,77,128,121,78,44,108,113,247,254,212,192,140,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
