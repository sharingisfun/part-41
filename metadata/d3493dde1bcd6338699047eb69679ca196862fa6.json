Entombed for twenty years, Raena has been found and released.\r\n\r\nThallian has been on the lam for the last fifteen years; a wanted war criminal whose entire family has been hunted down and murdered for their role in the galaxy-wide genocide of the Templars. His name is the first on Raenaâ€™s list, as heâ€™s the one that enslaved her, made her his assassin, and ultimate put her in a tomb. But Thallian is willing to risk everythingâ€”including his army of cloned sonsâ€”to capture her. Now itâ€™s a race to see who kills whom first.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Gaven has spent the last twenty years trying to forget about Raena, whom he once saved and then lost to the clutches of Thallian. Raenaâ€™s adopted sister, Ariel, has been running from the truth: the one about Raena, about her and Gaven, and doesnâ€™t know if sheâ€™ll be able to face either of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Liv Anderson\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3493dde1bcd6338699047eb69679ca196862fa6","amp;dn":"Loren+Rhoads+-+The+Dangerous+Type+%28In+the+Wake+of+the+Templars+%23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3493dde1bcd6338699047eb69679ca196862fa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,73,61,222,27,205,99,56,105,144,71,235,105,103,156,161,150,134,47,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
