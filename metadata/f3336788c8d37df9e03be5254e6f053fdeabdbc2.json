As the bizarre album-title and cover art indicates, this is not a traditional doom metal record. The experimental and odd nature of this album warrants a track-by-track breakdown to fully comprehend its schizophrenic ways.\n\n \n\nOpium+Warlords++2012\n\n \n\nThe opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sxi-MeruÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a mix of distorted noise, windchimes, and some light strumming, immediately setting a slow deliberate pace and cementing an eerie atmosphere. This project is seemingly HynninenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal catharsis, and the creepy mood feels like a reflection of a troubled mind. Though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost five minutes long, the drones of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sxi-MeruÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can safely be classified as an extended intro.\n\n \n\nClocking in at twelve minutes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SlippyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ must be considered the centerpiece of We Meditate... Starting off with some tribal-sounding drums over a church organ, it soon devolves into some odd fast riffs, cymbal crashes and full-on black metal vocals. These frantic sections are interspersed with quiet, almost beautiful, doom strumming. From black metal, to doom, and then culminating in what can only be described as progressive rock. This eclectic mix reveals an avant-garde approach to making music, though the wildly different sections seldom feel properly woven together. There is something uncomfortable about drifting away with the gentle mid-section, before being thrown headfirst into some very malicious-sounding blackened doom metal. The song then trails off with the same tribal drums, before coming to an abrupt end. Reverend Bizarre, this is not.\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lament For The Builders Of Khara KhotoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shies away from the powerful weirdness of Ã¢â‚¬Å“SlippyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, opting instead for a bleak slab of funeral doom. The track feels ritualistic, with a thick bassline backed by some dire chanting and screams. Some discordant riffs also add to the feeling that something is eerily off about this track. The song is very unsettling, and showcases HynninenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to craft the dreadful.\n\n \n\nSo there you go Opium Warlords and a great place to meditate get it.......","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3336788c8d37df9e03be5254e6f053fdeabdbc2","amp;dn":"Opium+Warlords-We+Meditate+Under+The+Pussy+In+The+Sky+320k+ak201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3336788c8d37df9e03be5254e6f053fdeabdbc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,51,103,136,200,211,125,249,224,59,229,37,78,111,5,63,222,171,219,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
