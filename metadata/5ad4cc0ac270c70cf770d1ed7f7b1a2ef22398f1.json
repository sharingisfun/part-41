Title contenders Manchester City take on Southampton in the early kick-off. City won the last two clashes with Saints on home soil, and are anxious to secure three more points with the title race heating up.\n\nChelsea, meanwhile, entertain Stoke. The Potters had lost the last four league encounters at Stamford Bridge, conceding 11 times and failing to find the net. Things are no less important at the foot of the table, with relegation rivals Crystal Palace travelling to Cardiff and Norwich taking on West Brom.\n\nIn the day's other games, fellow strugglers Fulham play Aston Villa, Manchester United face Newcastle and Hull entertain Swansea.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ad4cc0ac270c70cf770d1ed7f7b1a2ef22398f1","amp;dn":"Match.Of.The.Day.2014.04.05.720p.HDTV.x264-FTP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ad4cc0ac270c70cf770d1ed7f7b1a2ef22398f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,212,204,10,194,112,199,12,247,112,209,237,127,123,26,46,242,35,152,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
