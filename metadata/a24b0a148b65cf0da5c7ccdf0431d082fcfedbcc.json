She shows the methodical use of both collective as in a natural disaster or coup d&amp;#039;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tat, and shock perpetrated against individuals as torture and it&amp;#039;s cousins, from the experiments in brain washing done at McGill University in the 1950s to modern day applications from the September 11th, 1973 coup in Chile to Katrina to Iraq. She has a wealth of irrefutable documentation to support her assertions including names, places, documents and the long list of impoverished populations the Neo Cons have left in their wake.\n\nThis audio book is in MP3 format at 128 k/sec.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a24b0a148b65cf0da5c7ccdf0431d082fcfedbcc","amp;dn":"The+Shock+Doctrine_+The+Rise+of+Disaster+Capitalism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a24b0a148b65cf0da5c7ccdf0431d082fcfedbcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,75,10,20,139,101,207,13,165,199,204,223,4,49,208,130,252,254,219,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
