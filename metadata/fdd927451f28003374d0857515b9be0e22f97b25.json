The previous two volumes focused on Elvis in June 1975 , this time we find Elvis in South Bend , October 20, 1976.\nFrom this tour (number 22) , we already have two great sounding bootlegs. They are Chicago Beat and Bringin' The House Down - both from Chicago - October 14 and 15 respectively. This show from South Bend is of course similar to these, also contents wise.\nEternal Flame is a complete soundboard recording (except from some seconds missing of Funny How Time Slips Away and the introduction of Bobby Ogdin). \nThe show was also released on the Snowball label under the same title. \n\n\nWith covers! Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdd927451f28003374d0857515b9be0e22f97b25","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Eternal+flame+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdd927451f28003374d0857515b9be0e22f97b25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,217,39,69,31,40,0,51,116,208,133,117,21,185,190,14,34,249,123,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
