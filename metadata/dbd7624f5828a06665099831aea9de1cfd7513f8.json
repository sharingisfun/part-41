(Definitive Edition)\n\nThis is an expanded edition of Radio KAOS that was released by Project KAOS back in 2000. \nIt fleshes out the concept far better by including tracks that were used as b-sides and the When The Wind Blows soundtrack, and resequencing it all together to make a better storyline.\nIt also uses some clever reconstructing of &quot;Billy&quot; towards the end to recreate the dialog used in the KAOS vhs and concerts.\n\n1.  Get Back To Radio\n2.  Radio Waves (Extended)\n3.  Who Needs Information\n4.  Folded Flags\n5.  Me Or Him\n6.  Towers of Faith\n7.  The Powers That Be\n8.  Going To Live In L.A.\n9.  The Fish Report With A Beat\n10. Sunset Strip\n11. Home\n12. Four Minutes\n13. The Tide Is Turning (After Live Aid)\n14. Pipes And Drums\n\nI am unsure of the kpbs of the original, but this FLAC is made from my CD that was created from the original mp3 files, which were available as downloadable MP3 only. \nAfter owning this for so long, I can only listen to this version anymore. It adds so much more to the &quot;Billy&quot; concept like the concerts did. Hope you enjoy as I have!\n\nRemixed and Resequenced 2000 Project KAOS\nby Chad Hendrickson.\nThank you Chad wherever you are! And if you have the lossless version of this.. pleeeeease share with us! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbd7624f5828a06665099831aea9de1cfd7513f8","amp;dn":"Roger+Waters+-+Project+KAOS+%28Radio+KAOS+Expanded%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbd7624f5828a06665099831aea9de1cfd7513f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,215,98,79,88,40,160,102,101,9,152,49,174,169,222,28,253,117,19,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
