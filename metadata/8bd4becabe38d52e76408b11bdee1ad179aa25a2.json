A pupil and devotee of George Harmonica Smith, Clarke was a technical virtuoso and master of both the diatonic harp and the more difficult chromatic harp (the signature instrument of both Smith and Little Walter). Where many new harmonica players had become content to cop licks from the Chicago masters, Clarke developed his own style and vocabulary, building on everything he learned from Smith and moving beyond it. His four '90s albums for Alligator earned wide critical acclaim and remain his signature showcases. \n\nThis time he has added a horn section on some of the cuts here. No problem. Alex Schultz is here on lead guitar to make sure that this album rocks, while Clarke once again writes most of the songs -- all 15 fat tracks. By this time, his Alligator albums have a style and feel all his own that one looks forward to. Plenty of high-impact amplified chromatic harmonica here of the push-the-band-hard variety that Clarke does so well, plus some tasty acoustic thrown in, too.
