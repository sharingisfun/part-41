She made her recording debut in 1990 under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, and became the first recording artist to have her first five singles top the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993, Carey enjoyed a series of hit records from the diamond certified albums Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995). She later released the holiday standard &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; from her 1994 album, Merry Christmas, which helped to establish her position as Columbia Records' top-selling act.\n\nFollowing her separation from Mottola in 1997, she introduced elements of hip hop into her album work, to much initial success, but when she left Columbia in 2001 her popularity was in decline. She signed an unprecedented $100 million deal with Virgin Records, only to be dropped from the label and bought out of her contract in the following year. This turn of events was due to the highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown, as well as the poor reception that was given to Glitter, her film and soundtrack project. In 2002 Carey signed a $24 million deal with Island Records, and after a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of pop music in 2005 with her album The Emancipation of Mimi.[4][5] The album became her best-selling album in the 2000s and its single, &quot;We Belong Together&quot;, became the most successful solo single of her music career and was awarded &quot;Song of the Decade&quot; by Billboard. Ending the decade, Carey starred in the film Precious (2009), whose performance earned her a &quot;Breakthrough Performance Award&quot; at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and a NAACP Image Award nomination.\n\nIn a career spanning over two decades, Carey has sold more than 200 million albums, singles, and videos worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists.[6][7][8] Carey was cited as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards in 1998,[9][10] and was named the best-selling female artist of the millennium by the same awards show in 2000.[11][12][13] According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the third-best-selling female artist, with shipments of 63 million albums in the U.S. In April 2008, &quot;Touch My Body&quot; became Carey's eighteenth number one single on the Hot 100, the most by any solo artist.[14][15] Aside from her commercial accomplishments, she has earned five Grammys,[16] seventeen World Music Awards,[17] and is known for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Collection 2010\n\n\nPlaylist: The Very Best of Mariah Carey is a compilation album by American R&amp;B singer Mariah Carey.[1] The album features some of Carey's released and unreleased songs (as singles) over the course of her career.\n\nThe album was released on January 26, 2010 as part of the Playlist music album series issued by Legacy Recordings, simultaneously with similarly unsanctioned best-of collections of the bands and solo artists Suicidal Tendencies, Blue ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œyster Cult, Joe Satriani, Omarion, Steve Vai, 311, R. Kelly, KRS-One and the Backstreet Boys.\n\nThe album was released in Australia on January 21, 2011, almost a year after its official release date internationally. (On this date, Greatest Hits was re-released in Australia under the title The Essential Mariah Carey, and Carey's DVD MTV Unplugged +3 was finally released as well.) Under two weeks later, Sony Music Australia announced that they would re-release the album as The Collection on February 11, 2011.\n\nThe album contains some of Mariah Carey's hits and singles, and also some songs from her previous albums from her time at Columbia Records. It does not feature any new material or include songs recorded with her current label, Island Records, or her previous label, Virgin Records. It is a part of Sony Legacy's Playlist compilation albums series.[2][3] Playlist: The Very Best of Mariah Carey is a compilation of remastered original recordings by Mariah. The playlist includes select greatest hits and some of Carey's favorite tracks that were not released as singles. The CD comes in eco-friendly packaging made of recyclable materials. A PDF file included on the CD contains the song credits, photographs, and full liner notes.[1] The difference in between Carey's previous greatest hits compilations and Playlist is that her previous ones had her most successful hits; Playlist had songs that in her opinion, were hits, meaning there were some non-singles included such as &quot;Underneath the Stars&quot; from Daydream, which she said was one of her favorite songs by herself in the booklet of her 2009 album Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel. Even &quot;Outside&quot; and &quot;Babydoll&quot; from Butterfly were included.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Dreamlover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n2.\t&quot;Bliss&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n3.\t&quot;Melt Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n4.\t&quot;Breakdown&quot; (featuring Krayzie Bone &amp; Wish Bone) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n5.\t&quot;Make It Happen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n6.\t&quot;Outside&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n7.\t&quot;Vanishing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n8.\t&quot;Looking In&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n9.\t&quot;Emotions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n10.\t&quot;Babydoll&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n11.\t&quot;I Am Free&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n12.\t&quot;Fantasy&quot; (Bad Boy Remix featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n13.\t&quot;Underneath the Stars&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n14.\t&quot;Rainbow (Interlude)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:47\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0354fa5def71fa035e0c8fa86bdd20ee41fdc596","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+-+The+Collection+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0354fa5def71fa035e0c8fa86bdd20ee41fdc596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,84,250,93,239,113,250,3,94,12,143,168,107,221,32,238,65,253,197,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
