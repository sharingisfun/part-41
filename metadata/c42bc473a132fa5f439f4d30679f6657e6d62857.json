I am really glad I\nhave at least a tape copy of it, because it's one of the better concerts\nthey gave. The four parts comprising this recording are one to one copies\nfrom two C60 tapes, played back without noise reduction and &quot;ripped&quot; as-is.\nThus you may feel the need to post process the sound in one way or another,\nbut that's up to you.\n\nWith the exception of the first track, which is cut off at about two thirds\nof &quot;At Night&quot;, all other tracks are overlapping in one or two seconds, so\nyou can glue them together for a complete concert impression. Besides: this\nversion of &quot;Forever&quot; isn't only one of the longest, but definitely one of\nthe best ever!\n\n\nTrack list:\n=============================================\nTape 1, Side A (31:09):\n---------------------------------------------\nThe Figurehead\nM\nThe Drowning Man\nA Short Term Effect\nCold\nAt Night (uncomplete)\n\n---------------------------------------------\nTape 1, Side B (29:24):\n---------------------------------------------\nSplintered In Her Head\nThree Imaginary Boys\nSiamese Twins\nPrimary\nThe Hanging Garden\nPlay For Today\nA Strange Day\n\n---------------------------------------------\nTape 2, Side A (20:51):\n---------------------------------------------\nA Forest\nPornography\n10:15 Saturday Night\nKilling An Arab\n\n---------------------------------------------\nTape 2, Side B (12:16):\n---------------------------------------------\nForever (complete!)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c42bc473a132fa5f439f4d30679f6657e6d62857","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Lyon%2C+1982","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c42bc473a132fa5f439f4d30679f6657e6d62857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,43,196,115,161,50,250,95,67,159,77,48,103,159,102,87,230,214,40,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
