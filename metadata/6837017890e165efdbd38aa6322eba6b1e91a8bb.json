The album follows Harris's acclaimed 2008 release, All I Intended to Be, which received widespread acclaim - Newsweek called it an album that &quot;shows that Harris is still the stalwart songbird at the top of the roost.&quot; Hard Bargain, which comprises 11 new songs by Harris as well as two covers, was produced by Jay Joyce (Cage the Elephant, Patty Griffin). \n\n\nThough other performers sold more records and earned greater fame, few left as profound an impact on contemporary music as Emmylou Harris. Blessed with a crystalline voice, a remarkable gift for phrasing, and a restless creative spirit, she traveled a singular artistic path, proudly carrying the torch of &quot;cosmic American music&quot; passed down by her mentor, Gram Parsons. With the exception of only Neil Young -- not surprisingly an occasional collaborator -- no other mainstream star established a similarly large body of work as consistently iconoclastic, eclectic, or daring; even more than three decades into her career, Harris' latter-day music remained as heartfelt, visionary, and vital as her earliest recordings.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t128 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tCountry/Pop\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Road\n02.Home Sweet Home\n03.My Name Is Emmett Till\n04.Goodnight Old World\n05.New Orleans\n06.Big Black Dog\n07.Lonely Girl\n08.Hard Bargain\n09.Six White Cadillacs\n10.Ship On His Arm\n11.Darlin' Kate\n12.Nobody\n13.Cross Yourself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6837017890e165efdbd38aa6322eba6b1e91a8bb","amp;dn":"Emmylou+Harris+-+Hard+Bargain++%2AAdvance%2A++%282011%29+mp3%40128","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6837017890e165efdbd38aa6322eba6b1e91a8bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,55,1,120,144,225,101,239,219,211,138,166,50,46,186,107,30,145,168,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
