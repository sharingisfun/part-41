I found bugs in the website with same ip and uploaded web-shell through this site.\nThen I hacked plesk parallels control panel and gained access to Britam Defence mail accounts and website directory.\n \nLeaked documents:\n-       Contracts copies with signatures\n-       Private email correspondence\n-       Personnel data, etc.\n \nBritam Defence is British private military company, operates mainly in the Middle East. It killed Arabs in Iraq and plans to invade in Iran and Syria.\nLook through leaked documents carefully. CW means chemical weapon, g-shell is short for a gas shell I guess.\n \nHelp to distribute this info and let other people know about the threats.\nThank all&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6abe339b23e818f21314ea76341b3dcb92dd8838","amp;dn":"Britam+millitary+server+hacked.+Syriah+false+flag.+Confidential+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6abe339b23e818f21314ea76341b3dcb92dd8838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,190,51,155,35,232,24,242,19,20,234,118,52,27,61,203,146,221,136,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
