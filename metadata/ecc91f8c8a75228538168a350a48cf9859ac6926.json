Whether you're a photographer with thousands of &quot;IMG_&quot; files, or someone who needs to Windows-proof filenames, or someone who works with tons of clients and wants to use filenames to help sort client files properly, Name Mangler will help you safelyÃ¢â‚¬â€and very speedilyÃ¢â‚¬â€rename your files.\n\n\nPop-up solutions\n\nName Mangler makes most renaming tasks as easy as choosing your desired action from a pop-up menu, then configuring a few options for the chosen action. For example, the Change Case action offers the ability to change filenames to lowercase, to uppercase, or to title case.\n\nConfigure the chosen action, check the preview of the files' new names, click the Rename button, and that's all there is to it.\nSpeed thrills\n\nName Mangler is really fast. Watch the progress bar at right to see just how fastÃ¢â‚¬â€that's 5,000 files being renamed in just over three seconds. As fast as that is, some operations may go even faster.\n\nOther renamers may give you time to get a cup of coffee while processing your files, but Name Mangler gives you something much better: your files, renamed. Which would you rather have?\n\nRenaming speed will vary based on drive speed, Mac used, etc.\nStreamline operations with multi-step\n\nNeed to massage your files in more than one way? No need to run Name Mangler multiple times on the same files. Just add another stepÃ¢â‚¬â€or tenÃ¢â‚¬â€to your action, and Name Mangler will do everything for you, all in one pass.\n\nSteps can be rearranged, added, or deleted at any time, and Name Mangler will instantly reflect the changes you make.\nMeta everywhere\n\nNeed access to your files' metdata? No problem; Name Mangler contains over 150 metdata fields available for use in your renaming actions. Certain numeric and date metadata values can even be formatted to your specifications.\n\nAll of this is available through the normal renaming interface, via an intuitive and blindingly-fast metadata browser. Just start typing, and the browser will quickly isolate matching fields.\nRepeating history isn't always bad\n\nName Mangler's elephant-like memory means you can easily access any previously-used renaming action, and reuse it with a couple of mouse clicks.\n\nBy default, Name Mangler remembers your last 50 renaming actions, but you can increase or decrease this value (or set it to unlimited or off) in the preferences.\nSave time with Presets\n\nPresets let you store your often-used renaming actions in a menu for fast future access. You can load and run as saved, or modify after loading to do something slightly different.\n\nYou can even share your presets between Macs via a syncing service, such as Dropbox or Box.\n\nName Mangler also includes a number of commonly-used renaming actions saved as Presets for quick access.\nUnlock the power of Advanced mode\n\nProgrammers and technical types can use Advanced mode to create mini programs that run within Name Mangler, solving even the most complex of renaming tasks. These programs can be saved for easy reuse, too.\n\nThe editor includes auto-completion, auto-indentation, tabbing to the next empty parameter, indenting and outdenting of full sections of code, and find and replace.\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nChange your mind after renaming your files? No problem; Name Mangler lets you revert the last-performed renaming action.\nInterim results show you your filenames at each step of a multi-step renaming action, making it easy to check your action before running it.\nYou can view only files that will be modified, which is incredibly useful if you're renaming only a handful out of hundreds of files in a folder.\n\nCreate Droplets, which are standalone &quot;apps&quot; that run a pre-configured renaming action. Drag and drop your files to the droplet, and you're done.\nTooltips show full filenames for ultra-long filenames that don't otherwise fit in the display.\nPotential duplicates are detected and flagged prior to renaming.\nImport and export renaming configurations to share with other Macs, or other Name Mangler users via email or web download.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecc91f8c8a75228538168a350a48cf9859ac6926","amp;dn":"Name+Mangler+3.2.1+%5BK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecc91f8c8a75228538168a350a48cf9859ac6926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,201,31,140,138,117,34,133,56,22,138,53,10,72,207,152,89,172,105,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
