Upcoming technologies are bound to fulfill their own unique social roles. How can we advance this social role so that it will support the good live and limit undesired changes? This book explores whether we can take a forward looking responsibility to optimize the social roles of technologies. In doing so, the book discusses three issues: first, it aims to understand the social role of technologies; second, it explores what it means to accept responsibility for this social role, and; third, it searches for some forward looking tools that help us to see how new technologies may influence human behavior. In a rather unique approach, this book combines the influential sociological research of Bruno Latour on the social impacts of technologies with the contemporary Aristotelianism of Alasdair MacIntyre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36d2d4eb8fe29649216ef3c371fabdc2afd62829","amp;dn":"Doing+Good+with+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36d2d4eb8fe29649216ef3c371fabdc2afd62829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,210,212,235,143,226,150,73,33,110,243,195,113,250,189,194,175,214,40,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
