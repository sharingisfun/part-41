Stark is out to shut down the Order of Warrior Nuns, and intends to use her performance to convince his superiors to do exactly that. A single misstep could mean the end of everything she's fought for! Meanwhile, an elite convocation of Magic Priests must get to the bottom of eerie phenomena in Libya. Do these strange goings-on require direct intervention by the Vatican... and if so, will the Warrior Nun Order still exist to deal with them?\n\nThanks goes to Talon13184 for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
