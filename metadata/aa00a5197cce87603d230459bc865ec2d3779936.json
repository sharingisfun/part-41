Auld Lang Syne \n\n\nOriginally released in 1964, this classic early Beach Boys album contains both traditional holiday songs like &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;Blue Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Frosty the Snowman,&quot; and Brian Wilson-penned originals like &quot;Little Saint Nick,&quot; &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby,&quot; and &quot;Christmas Day,&quot; the latter of which is also Al Jardine's lead vocal debut. A rarity in that half the album is produced by Dick Reynolds, the regular arranger for primary Beach Boys influences the Four Freshmen, rather than Brian Wilson himself, the CHRISTMAS ALBUM also features a gorgeous a cappella version of &quot;Auld Lang Syne,&quot; previously unreleased mixes, and contemporary interviews with both Brian and Dennis Wilson.\n\nSince Phil Spector produced the classic A CHRISTMAS MESSAGE FOR YOU, it's fitting that Brian Wilson would emulate his idol once again and release a superior Christmas album of his own. Like BEACH BOYS PARTY!, another &quot;novelty&quot; record whose musical substance belies its humble origins, THE BEACH BOYS' CHRISTMAS ALBUM is the finished work of just emerged professionals.\n\nThe set begins with several Wilson originals, such as &quot;Little Saint Nick &quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;--tastefully produced in low-riding Beach Boys surfer style. Midway, the emphasis shifts to familiar Christmas standards such as &quot;Frosty The Snowman&quot; and &quot;We Three Kings,&quot; featuring the Boys' rich, Four Freshman-derived harmony work and accompanied by full orchestra just like the grown-ups do. One is reminded that Brian Wilson began his musical education by figuring out those complex Four Freshman vocal parts on an old upright piano in his room. And if one ever needed reminding, again his homework paid off in droves.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa00a5197cce87603d230459bc865ec2d3779936","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+The+Beach+Boys%5C%27+Christmas+Album+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa00a5197cce87603d230459bc865ec2d3779936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,0,165,25,124,206,135,96,61,35,4,89,188,134,94,194,211,119,153,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
