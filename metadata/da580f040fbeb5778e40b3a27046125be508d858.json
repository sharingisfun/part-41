This is Lead Zeppelin at its best and an illustration of How The West Was Won.&quot; - Jimmy Page, London, March 2003 \n\nAnd so Jimmy Page, along with engineer and mixer Kevin Shirley, choose the best of those two nights and created Led Zeppelin's best live album, and one of the greatest live albums of all time. \n\nOriginally released as a 3 CD set, this 48kHz 24-bit version is based on the stereo mix available on the 2 Disc DVD-Audio version, which was remastered by George Marino. Only difference is the fade-in-and-out between tracks 11 &amp; 12 has been removed. This was originally going to be done by flying in the CD version at the point, but it was discovered that, by carefully overlapping the two tracks, the fades cancelled out perfectly without any phasing or other artifacts. \n\nIn lossless FLAC format with replay gain metadata \n\n01.
