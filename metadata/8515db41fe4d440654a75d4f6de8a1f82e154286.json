Accompanied by strings and choir, Goldfrapp perform songs from Seventh Tree, their album of hazy English psychedelia. Cecil Sharp House is an all-seater venue.\n\n\nReview...\n\nIntense Goldfrapp\nBand don costumes and bring in choir for gig\n23 October 2008 - Goldfrapp brought a pagan feel to the intimate surroundings of Cecil Sharp House in a performance that singer Alison described as &quot;the most intense&quot; they've ever done.\n\nThe band were joined at the London venue by 12 string players and a chorus - all dressed in white, with the singers even wearing straw pagan masks. Alison was the only person in black, and her brief remarks between songs were the only break in what was a very close and at times eerie atmosphere.\n\nLow lights also helped capture the darker mood of tracks from their latest album Seventh Tree, which were perfectly suited to the surroundings. Highlights included Caravan Girl, Little Bird and Happiness, which was one of the lightest moments in the set. They also played Clowns, a track that was made available as a free download this week.\n\nMusically the approach was almost entirely acoustic with very few of the synthesizers that characterised Supernature on display. The band itself had eight members ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ including a harp and a violin. Will told 6 Music in the preparations for the gig that the prospect of using hardly any electronic equipment was 'scary' but there was no sign of nerves tonight.\n\n    &quot;I think this is the most intense thing we've ever done.&quot; Alison Goldfrapp\n\nPreviously electronic tracks were also given a minimalistic interpretation: Oh La La was a bluesy singalong with slide guitar while closer Black Cherry was more soulful than ever.\n\nThe strong connection between the choir and the band was very evident ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ choir master David Temple said before the gig that the singers had been made a part of the act from an early stage and spent many months in rehearsals. Some of the singers will also feature in Oasis' performance at the Roundhouse on Sunday.\n\nThe crowd were clearly transfixed by the performance and fans said afterwards that the setting was near perfect for the acoustic direction that Goldfrapp have been following recently.\n\nRodrigo Davies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8515db41fe4d440654a75d4f6de8a1f82e154286","amp;dn":"Goldfrapp+-+Live+%40+BBC+Electric+Proms+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8515db41fe4d440654a75d4f6de8a1f82e154286","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,21,219,65,254,77,68,6,84,167,93,79,109,232,161,248,46,21,66,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
