And you know you'll want more ...\n\nAlthough &quot;Crone of War&quot; is OMNIA's 4th CD to date, it is the first real PaganFolk album to cover the full range of their evergrowing spectrum of musical styles.\n\nBecause OMNIA is really into this &quot;misty-swirly&quot; &quot;heyaheya&quot; &quot;tree huggie&quot; kind of stuff they only play on authentic (acoustic) instruments on Crone of War and none of the recordings have been compressed, so as to keep the natural dynamics and emotion intact.\n\n1.
