He fell in love\nwith a local translator, who worked secretly for the independence\nmovement. Nessen lived for months on the frontlines with GAM\nindependence guerrillas, was hunted by the military, imprisoned for\n40 days and twice expelled from the country. Days after Nessen?s\nmarriage in Aceh, the security forces kidnapped and killed his\n&quot;best man&quot;, an outspoken human rights activist.\n\nThrough the lens of Nessen?s personal and powerful experiences\nemerges the first film to tell the story of Aceh?s rebellion\nagainst Indonesian rule.\n\nThe Black Road takes us on a journey deep inside Southeast Asia?s\nhottest conflict - a conflict that may well decide the fate of\nIndonesia, Australia?s closest neighbour and the world?s largest\nMuslim nation. The people of Aceh fight for political independence;\nIndonesia wants to keep the gas-rich province firmly under its\ncontrol.\n\nThe film brings us directly to the battlefields and burnt-out\nvillages of the province. We step into the lives and experience\nthe deaths of Aceh?s GAM guerrillas, its human rights activists\nand ordinary farmers. We march with demonstrators and witness the\nmassacres that follow. Acknowledging a hundred-year history of\nresistance to outside rule, the film focuses on the past three\nyears of escalating fighting, martial law and the banning of all\nforeign journalists.\n\nThe film begins and ends with extraordinary scenes that no other\njournalist has captured: the conflict continuing even in the rubble\nof the tsunami. But there is some laughter here too and the\npossibility of healing. It?s a story about how people endure,\nstruggle and maintain their dignity against the odds.\n\nThe Aceh conflict raises a crucial political question, which is the\nsubtext of the film: Is political freedom for a long-suffering people\nmore important than the right of a country to hold its disparate\nparts together?\n\nThe Black Road is also a startling account of a Nessen?s painful\nfour-year journey of self-discovery, as he is pulled deeper into the\nconflict and the tragedy and the personal lives of the Acehnese.\nNessen increasingly wrestles with the dilemmas of remaining an\nobserver in a place of terrible misdeeds.\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Aceh - The Black Road (2005-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 649 MB (or 665,344 KB or 681,312,256 bytes)\nFrames.......: 640x480 (1.33:1) [=4:3] @ 0.211 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1617 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc6cc27a1c7edfa86b8a10024e2d1fbea1eb6684","amp;dn":"Aceh+-+The+Black+Road+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc6cc27a1c7edfa86b8a10024e2d1fbea1eb6684","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,108,194,122,28,126,223,168,107,138,16,2,78,45,31,190,161,235,102,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
