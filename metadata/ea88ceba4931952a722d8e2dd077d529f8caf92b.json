In that time, the number, scope, and intensity of wars involving guerrillas and terrorists have increased dramatically. And there's no end in sight.\n\nThis isn't your standard military manual. Added to the original book are 10 new chapters on the narco-insurgency on the U.S-Mexican border, Hezbollah's American homeland insurgency, the role of politics and the media in guerrilla wars, how intelligence gets exploited for political ends, legal issues involved in fighting insurgents, the scourge of modern improvised explosive devices (IEDs), maritime piracy off Somalia and beyond, and in-depth analysis of the ongoing insurgencies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Yemen, Somalia, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and the Congo. Extensive new photography enhances the combat lessons.\n\nThis expanded and updated version of Guerrillas in the Mist explores insurgency and counterinsurgency history, as well as tactics, operational art, and strategy. It contains practical detail and philosophy for the asymmetric battlefield, as well as examining what has and hasn't worked, and why, in the unconventional wars of yesterday and today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea88ceba4931952a722d8e2dd077d529f8caf92b","amp;dn":"GUERRILLAS+IN+THE+MIST+Expanded+and+Updated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea88ceba4931952a722d8e2dd077d529f8caf92b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,136,206,186,73,49,149,42,114,45,142,45,208,119,213,41,248,202,249,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
