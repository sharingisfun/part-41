For four years, this group had been doing preparatory work as they planned to reform the art of cinema with an eye on montage.  Yet, for a long time, their ideas remained dry theory, because the workshop lacked resources to make films.  The focus of the Cine-Lab's practice was on acting ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tudes.  Details of scenes were story-boarded, photographed, or &quot;framed&quot; by special viewfinders in order to visualize how they might look in an edited film sequence.  Thanks to these exercises, the notion of montage that Kuleshov developed was inextricably linked to his ideas on acting and shot composition.  What he was aiming for was the aesthetics of American action films.  he admired them for their fast pace, well-wrought suspense, athletic performances, as well as narratively efficient framing and editing - in short, for everything that was missing from languid boudoir melodramas, which dominated the Russian screen before the Revolution.  Kuleshov's understanding of &quot;American montage&quot; came down to this essential rule:  each scene must be composed of brief sequences, filmed in close-ups or medium shots from different angles, so as to draw attention to the key phases of the character's movement and the most important details of his environment.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Mr West.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,152,958,464 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:13:37\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x544 (AR: 1.324)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1889 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.201 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015167/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015167/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSilent with Russian intertitles; English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by vertovfan, whom we thank\n\nLev Kuleshov - The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (1924)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4636cf1cd68c09207bba901a85de69f19af68c43","amp;dn":"Lev+Kuleshov+-+The+Extraordinary+Adventures+of+Mr.+West+in+the+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4636cf1cd68c09207bba901a85de69f19af68c43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,54,207,28,214,140,9,32,123,186,144,26,133,222,105,241,154,246,140,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
