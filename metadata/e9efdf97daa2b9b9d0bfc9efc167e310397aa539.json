Take your quinine, malaria is rampant. Make do: supplies will not arrive. Stay strong, despite the overwhelming odds.\n\nand from IMDB\n\n  &quot;The Army nurses on Bataan need help badly, but when it arrives, it sure isn't what they expected. A motley crew, including a Southern belle, a waitress, and a stripper, show up. Many conflicts arise among these women who are thrown together in what is a desperate and ultimately hopeless situation.\n- Written by &lt;&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e1adb3808c918498a19289848d8dcfd09295888f9584938f8495cf828e8c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&gt;&quot; \n\n  My notes\n\n  The distinguishing feature of this WWII film is that all of the \nfeatured players are women and they all give their best.  Joan Blondell from\nmusicals is seen here in a dramatic role.  Ann (Foxy MacNamara) Sothern plays a darker role than she did on television in The Ann Sothern Show.  And there's Ella Rains whose &quot;Somewhere In The Night&quot; is one of the best noirs made.  I first saw Francis Gifford in an Alan Ladd picture.  She had maybe three lines as a nurse.  But I didn't forget that scene.  They are all here playing mature women's roles in a war-time setting.\n\n  The torrent is given because I have not seen it elsewhere on any index.
