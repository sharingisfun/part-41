Now, the American Gunsmithing Institute has a new DVD release on Taming Wildcats: How To Design &amp; Fabricate Custom Cartridges.\r\n\r\nAGIâ€™s newest course, taught by custom gunsmith Fred Zeglin, renowned cartridge designer and builder of the well-known Hawk series of cartridges, will get the viewer on the road to a thorough understanding of Wildcats and Wildcatting. This DVD will also explain and show the viewer everything he needs to know to do it himself.\r\n\r\nOne doesnâ€™t need to be a master machinist or tool and die maker to be able to turn out the blank resizing / forming / chamber reamers on the lathe; a tool post grinder is also not needed. A bench grinder with a good fine grinding wheel and some practice will, with Zeglinâ€™s expert and easy to follow guidance, enable the viewer to turn out reamers that will equal anything one can buy â€“ and for a whole lot less! The viewer will also learn how to sharpen and heat treat them.\r\n\r\nThis DVD includes:\r\n\r\n    Introduction to Wildcat and Wildcatting\r\n    The Five Cartridge Design Steps\r\n    Canon Reamers\r\n    Resizing Die Reamers\r\n    Making a Reamer\r\n    Heat Treating a Reamer\r\n    Relief Grinding\r\n    Sharpening a Reamer\r\n    Forming the Brass\r\n    Making a Chamber Reamer\r\n    Using the Reamer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1807c6e0a04cce19c639482757b9a0b089e913c4","amp;dn":"AGI+Taming+Wildcat+Cartridges","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1807c6e0a04cce19c639482757b9a0b089e913c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,7,198,224,160,76,206,25,198,57,72,39,87,185,160,176,137,233,19,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
