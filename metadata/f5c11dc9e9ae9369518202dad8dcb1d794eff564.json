LL Cool J stands for &quot;Ladies love Cool James.&quot; He is known for romantic ballads such as &quot;I Need Love&quot; and &quot;Hey Lover&quot; as well as pioneering hip-hop such as &quot;Headsprung&quot;, &quot;I Can't Live Without My Radio&quot;, &quot;I'm Bad&quot;, &quot;The Boomin' System&quot;, &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot;, and &quot;4, 3, 2, 1&quot;. He has also appeared in several films. LL Cool J is one of a few hip-hop stars of his era to sustain a successful recording career for more than two decades. He has released twelve studio albums and a greatest hits compilation so far, with his latest album being 2008's Exit 13, the last for LL's record deal with Def Jam Recordings. He now resides in Manhasset, New York with his wife and four children. The couple has also adopted several times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLL Cool J ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ All World 1996\n\n\nAll World: The Greatest Hits is the first greatest hits compilation from hip hop artist LL Cool J, released in 1996. It covers his career from the time of his Def Jam debut Radio, to his 1995 album Mr. Smith. One noticeable track missing is his 1989 song &quot;I'm That Type of Guy&quot; which was not added to the album list. Instead a remix of his 1995 track &quot;Loungin&quot; from Mr. Smith was added which features R&amp;B trio Total.[citation needed] All World has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1\t&quot;I Can't Live Without My Radio&quot;\n2\t&quot;Rock the Bells&quot;\n3\t&quot;I'm Bad&quot;\n4\t&quot;I Need Love&quot;\n5\t&quot;Going Back to Cali&quot;\n6\t&quot;Jack The Ripper&quot;\n7\t&quot;Jingling Baby (Remixed But Still Jingling)&quot;\n8\t&quot;Big Ole Butt&quot;\n9\t&quot;The Boomin' System&quot;\n10\t&quot;Around The Way Girl&quot;\n11\t&quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot;\n12\t&quot;Back Seat&quot;\n13\t&quot;I Need a Beat&quot;\n14\t&quot;Doin It&quot;\n15\t&quot;Loungin (Who Do Ya Luv)&quot;\n16\t&quot;Hey Lover&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c11dc9e9ae9369518202dad8dcb1d794eff564","amp;dn":"LL+Cool+J+-+All+World+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c11dc9e9ae9369518202dad8dcb1d794eff564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,193,29,201,233,174,147,105,81,130,2,218,216,220,177,215,148,239,245,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
