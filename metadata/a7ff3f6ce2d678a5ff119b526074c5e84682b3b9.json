We talk about new reports that US troops are being deployed on the border to deal with the increasingly deadly drug gangs, and what people can do to change the course of this disastrous drug war. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://narcosphere.narconews.com/notebook/bill-conroy/2012/02/us-troops-may-now-be-coping-fast-and-furious-fallout&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://narcosphere.narconews.com/notebook/bill-conroy/2012/02/us-troops-may-now-be-coping-fast-and-furious-fallout&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
