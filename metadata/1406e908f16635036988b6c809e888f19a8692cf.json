It also has \n           Trip from Enterprise, and Ando from heroes in it. Also\n           this was recorded from analog tv, so you should know\n           what quality you are getting. I tried my best to \n           denoise, but it still impacted quality. If you want\n           perfect quality, wait for a dvdrip or something. SciFi\n           also fucked up the credits, by squeezing them, and \n           putting ads for antoher show. I cut 'em out, but if \n           you really care, read credits.txt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1406e908f16635036988b6c809e888f19a8692cf","amp;dn":"Star.Runners.TVRip.XviD-AMiGOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1406e908f16635036988b6c809e888f19a8692cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,6,233,8,241,102,53,3,105,136,182,200,9,232,136,241,154,134,146,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
