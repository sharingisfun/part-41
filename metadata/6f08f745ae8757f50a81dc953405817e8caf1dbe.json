He&amp;#039;s much better at it than me. It should mean this issue looks better and is easier to read. You can find out more about him at sgj-design.com.\n\nHe also drew two awesome sketches that you&amp;#039;ll find in the magazine. Send him a nice note at his website and maybe he&amp;#039;ll draw you a picture too.\n\nWe only have two stories in this issue, but they are both really good. &quot;In the Kitchen, After the War&quot; by Adam Moorad and &quot;When Maggie Went Away&quot; by Tammy L.
