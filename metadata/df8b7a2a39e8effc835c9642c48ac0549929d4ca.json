Specializing in cases of cheating spouses, private \ninvestigator Jake 'J.J.' Gittes is tailing Hollis Mulwray, whose wife \nsuspects him of marital infidelity. Mulwray is the high profile chief \nengineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Him being \nhigh profile is because of the chronic drought in the Los Angeles area \nand the importance of fresh water to the growing community. Most of what \nGittes witnesses in following Mulwray are some usual and some not so usual \nbusiness dealings, among the former being a public meeting for construction \nof a new dam to create an additional water supply for Los Angeles, the dam \nwhich Mulwray opposes. But Gittes eventually witnesses Mulwray meeting with \na young unknown woman who is not his wife. Once news of the supposed tryst \nbetween Mulwray and this woman hits the media, additional information comes \nto light that makes Gittes believe that Mulwray is being framed for \nsomething and that he himself is being set-up. Gittes is assisted in his \ninvestigation of the issue behind Mulwray's framing and his own set-up by \nMulwray's wife, Evelyn Mulwray. Despite Evelyn's help, Gittes also believes \nthat she isn't being totally forthright with him. The further he gets into \nthe investigation, the more secrets he uncovers about the professional and \npersonal dealings of the Mulwrays, which includes Mulwray's former business \npartnership with Evelyn's father, Noah Cross. The identity of the unknown \nwoman may be the key to uncovering the whole story.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Jack Nicholson.\n=&gt;-Faye Dunaway.\n=&gt;-John Huston.\n=&gt;-Roman Polanski\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Roman Polanski.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Mystery : Thriller.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1974.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.97 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 157 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 10mn.\n=&gt;-Chinatown 1974.............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chinatown/\n=&gt;-Chinatown 1974.............: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-chinatown-1974/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1920 x 800.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 910 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 232 Kbps.\n\nAudio English Commentary.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 188 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English.\n=&gt;-English SDH","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df8b7a2a39e8effc835c9642c48ac0549929d4ca","amp;dn":"Chinatown+-+Jack+Nicholson+Mystery+1974+Eng+Comm+Subs+1080p+%5BH26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df8b7a2a39e8effc835c9642c48ac0549929d4ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,139,122,42,57,232,239,252,131,92,150,66,196,138,192,84,153,41,212,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
