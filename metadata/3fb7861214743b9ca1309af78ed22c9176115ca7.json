Difficult to describe without giving everything away and I have to say that at a certain point about two thirds into the movie, I guessed what was going on. I doubt views in the 40s did though and this remains a most unusual movie with some very real scary moments. Not a lot or tearaway action but plenty of mind games and surreal goings on. The opening is spellbinding and an absolute thrill, the acting with DeForest Kelley and Paul Kelly is fine, even if the latter struggles now and again in what is a very difficult role. Clearly made for nothing, written and directed by Shane, this is a great example of what can be done in cinema with just a bit of imagination and a decent story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb7861214743b9ca1309af78ed22c9176115ca7","amp;dn":"Fear+in+the+Night+-+Film+noir+1947","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb7861214743b9ca1309af78ed22c9176115ca7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,183,134,18,20,116,59,156,161,48,154,247,142,210,44,145,118,17,92,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
