This version gave me the opportunity to explore tracks of extended length and complexity. Because the N64 allowed me to use all the available samples I was able to achieve many combinations of textures for each level. The result is distinctive but still feels connected to the overall style of the first two soundtracks I composed for the series.&quot;\n\nReleased 12 January 2013.\n\nIf you like the music, support the artist, buy it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a685844efd15b26e84de0fc1c9cabf3e21702b15","amp;dn":"Doom+64+OST+by+Aubrey+Hodges+%282013%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a685844efd15b26e84de0fc1c9cabf3e21702b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,133,132,78,253,21,178,110,132,222,15,193,201,202,191,62,33,112,43,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
