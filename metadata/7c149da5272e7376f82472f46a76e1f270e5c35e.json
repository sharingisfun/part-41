The most powerful hallucination-inducing psychoactive substances known to mankind. Fact is that these plants, mushrooms and chemicals have been used throughout history by virtually all peoples and cultures. But why on Earth would anyone feel a need to explore altered states of consciousness? Is it just for curiosity or fun? Can these experiences teach you anything? Do they really take you out of reality? What IS reality anyway?\n\nTo get an insight and some possible answers, just ask the experts: the Psychonauts. They are the explorers of the mind, who journey into their psyche using hallucinogenic drugs. Psychonauts believe that these spiritual experiences, when properly processed, lead to long-term and positive benefits in their everyday lives. \n\nDirector AndrÃƒÂ¡s KovÃƒÂ¡cs M. takes you to a fascinating journey straight into the psychonauts' minds. In his intense and intelligent film, 9 young adults make intimate and thought-provoking confessions on their use of hallucinogens. Exploring such topics as Buddhism, Christianity, shamanism, psychology, scientific research and drug policy, their accounts and arguments are of interest for everyone with an open mind.\n\n=== English, Russian, German, Finnish, and Czech subtitles ===","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c149da5272e7376f82472f46a76e1f270e5c35e","amp;dn":"Psychonauts+%282006%29+%5Bpsychedelic+documentary%5D+-+Daath.hu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c149da5272e7376f82472f46a76e1f270e5c35e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,20,157,165,39,46,115,118,248,36,114,244,106,118,225,242,112,229,195,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
