R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and the fantasy genre in general, in a style similar to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It was written by &quot;A. P. R. Marshall and J. H. W. Lloyd&quot; (Andrew Marshall and John Lloyd) and produced by Geoffrey Perkins\n\n\nThe kingdom of Albion is under threat from The Evil One. The elves have trusted the kingdom with a mystic device (the number seven) and have entrusted a wizard by the name of Radox The Green to find a hero to save the land, in the shape of Agar Son of Athar.\n\nwww.comedy.org.uk Review: Quote:An interesting series that was created around the time that The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was broadcast. It contains some good ideas but the series has, these days, been largely forgotten.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/hordes_of_the_things/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/hordes_of_the_things/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCast:\nFrank Middlemass\nPaul Eddington\nSimon Callow\nMaggie Steed\nJonathan Lynn\nChristian Rodska\n\n\n\nHordes Of The Things - S01 - E01 - The First Chronicle\nHordes Of The Things - S01 - E02 - The Second Chronicle\nHordes Of The Things - S01 - E03 - The Third Chronicle\nHordes Of The Things - S01 - E04 - The Fourth Chornicle\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n[b]\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.\n\nThere is little point in downloading a &quot;Torrent&quot; and then recreating a &quot;Torrent&quot; using the same files.\n\nThe fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,\n\nAll you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the &quot;same&quot; files and make both have less seeders.\n\n\n\n[/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80030595d72c12c56d1ab1a36fe183cd50406f9c","amp;dn":"Hordes+Of+The+Things+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80030595d72c12c56d1ab1a36fe183cd50406f9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,3,5,149,215,44,18,197,109,26,177,163,111,225,131,205,80,64,111,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
