In the street he meets a young boy, who lives there as a street urchin, at deaths door after a neo-fascists attack. The boy, alcohol addicted, hears the voice of Maria Callas, speaks with the dead diva, with the mother he misses. In overdose he dreams of the perfect world. &quot;Red Maria&quot; saves the boy and teaches him the &quot;job&quot;. In order to survive they invade cafes, giving performances that talk for a new, political God, for the political mistake of God, for the end of the ideology. Their world is magical, poetical. And wild. &quot;Red Maria&quot; teaches the boy how to survive. Together they become the magician of the tribe, the holy fool, the rebel. They live a magical personal revolution. But a number of murders will change &quot;Red Maria&quot; and the boy from ideologists, into serial killers.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CanmeaaFK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CanmeaaFK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/canMFAAFk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/canMFAAFk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAnMgaaFk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cAnMgaaFk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caNmhAafK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caNmhAafK&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat            : Matroska at 1947 Kbps\nLength            : 1 GiB for 1h 35mn 2s 880ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1669 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 384 (1.875) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e59e39dbcddf25f921139c1ff2aaee47dc400e","amp;dn":"The+Rebellion+of+Red+Maria+%282011%29+Greek+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e59e39dbcddf25f921139c1ff2aaee47dc400e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,229,158,57,219,205,223,37,249,33,19,156,31,242,170,238,71,220,64,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
