(Very large, long-range cannons capable of shooting more than 100 miles.) When a plan by the CIA to export restricted material was exposed, the CIA denied all knowledge, and Bull had to go to jail. He was later released to help Saddam Hussein build a new supergun capable of firing over 500 miles into Israel. Bull was killed in 1990. Look out for a very young Clive Owen (Elisabeth: The golden age) in a smaller part. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109650/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109650/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGood stereo sound, fullscreen. Burn tested, runs well in my divX player.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d95f4cdd0fd6bae2adc72e24e1044f8e922293","amp;dn":"Doomsday+Gun+%5B1994%5D+DVDrip+%28Kevin+Spacey_Frank+Langella%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d95f4cdd0fd6bae2adc72e24e1044f8e922293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,217,95,76,221,15,214,186,226,173,199,46,36,225,4,79,142,146,34,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
