On this day, Anna comes back, ostensibly looking for a bracelet. She is the lead in his new production of Stindberg's &quot;A Dream Play.&quot; She talks of her hatred for her mother, now dead, an alcoholic actress, who was Vogler's star and lover. Vogler falls into a reverie, remembering a day Anna's mother, Rakel, late in life, came after rehearsal to beg him to come to her apartment. He awakes and Anna reveals the reason she has returned: she jolts him into an emotional response, rare for him, and the feelings of a young woman and an older man play out.\n\nPlease seed after downloading..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08685e1686eda9c4c3691a9d56a990f7fc769159","amp;dn":"After+the+Rehearsal+%281984%29+%5BIngmar+Bergman%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08685e1686eda9c4c3691a9d56a990f7fc769159","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,104,94,22,134,237,169,196,195,105,26,157,86,169,144,247,252,118,145,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
