They represent creative new thinking about challenging policy issues and offer useful options for policy makers. Five specific themes are covered in separate sections. They include: fundamental nature and objectives of equalization grants and their consequences on efficiency and equity; appropriate institutional setting for the design and implementation of equalization grant systems; challenges in the design of formulas with limited data availability for recurrent and capital purposes; coordination of equalization grants with other related policies; political economy behind equalization transfers.\n\n&quot;There is a genuine need for this book; it will become a 'benchmark' reference. I am impressed with its content, organization, readability, and fresh thematic approach.&quot; Robert D.
