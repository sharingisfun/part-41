Millero (CRC, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4665-1255-9\r\n\r\nOver the past ten years, a number of new large-scale oceanographic programs have been initiated. These include the Climate Variability Program (CLIVAR) and the recent initiation of the Geochemical Trace Metal Program (GEOTRACES). These studies and future projects will produce a wealth of information on the biogeochemistry of the worldâ€™s oceans. Authored by Frank J. Millero, an acknowledged international authority in the field, the fourth edition of Chemical Oceanography maintains the stellar insight that has made it a favorite of students, instructors, researchers, and other professionals in marine science, geochemistry, and environmental chemistry. Reflecting the latest updates on issues affecting the health of our environment, this text:\r\n\r\nSupplies an in-depth treatment of ocean acidification, a key emerging environmental problem\r\nProvides updated coverage on the carbonate system in the ocean\r\nPresents expanded information on oceanic organic compounds\r\nContains updates on dissolved organic carbon, phosphate, nitrogen, and metals in the ocean\r\nOffers a new definition of salinity and a new equation of the state of seawater based on recent, original research\r\nDescribes the new thermodynamic equation of the state of seawater\r\nIncludes full-color graphs and photographs to assist readers in visualizing the concepts presented\r\n\r\nFor more than two decades, this book has served as the &quot;classic&quot; textbook for students and a valuable reference for researchers in the fields of oceanography, environmental chemistry, and geochemistry. Designed for both classroom use and self-study, this comprehensive survey of essential concepts incorporates a wealth of state-of-the-art reference data discovered on large-scale oceanographic studies sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f69412114f9d8047a3476f93c6e94135ba9530","amp;dn":"Chemical+Oceanography+4th+ed+-+Frank+J.+Millero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f69412114f9d8047a3476f93c6e94135ba9530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,246,148,18,17,79,157,128,71,163,71,111,147,198,233,65,53,186,149,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
