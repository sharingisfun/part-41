Levov's happy and conventional upper middle class life is ruined by \nthe domestic social and political turmoil of the 1960s, which in the novel is \ndescribed as a manifestation of the &quot;indigenous American berserk&quot;. \n\nThe novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998 and was included in Time's &quot;All-TIME \n100 Greatest Novels&quot;. The film rights to it were later optioned by Paramount \nPictures. In 2006, it was one of the runners-up in the &quot;What is the Greatest \nWork of American Fiction in the Last 25 Years?&quot; contest held by the New York \nTimes Book Review.\n- - -\n\nAMERICAN PASTORAL - Seymour &quot;Swede&quot; Levov-a legendary high school athlete, a \ndevoted family man, a hard worker, the prosperous inheritor of his father's \nNewark glove factory-comes of age in thriving, triumphant postwar America. \nBut everything he loves is lost when the country begins to run amok in the \nturbulent 1960s. Not even the most private, well-intentioned citizen, it \nseems, gets to sidestep the sweep of history. American Pastoral is the story \nof a fortunate American's rise and fall-of a strong, confident master of \nsocial equilibrium overwhelmed by the forces of social disorder. For the \nSwede is not allowed to stay forever blissful inside the beloved hundred-and-\nseventy-year-old stone farmhouse, in rural Old Rimrock, where he lives \nwith his pretty wife-the college sweetheart who was Miss New Jersey of \n1949-and the lively, precocious daughter who is the apple of his eye, that is \nuntil she grows up to be a revolutionary terrorist.\n\n* Pulitzer Prize Winner, Fiction, 1998\n* Audie Award Winner, Best Narration, 1998\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n&gt;&gt;American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5997b4af9a0656c70a53ef985548f6e16ed4744c","amp;dn":"AMERICAN+PASTORAL+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+Ron+Silver+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5997b4af9a0656c70a53ef985548f6e16ed4744c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,151,180,175,154,6,86,199,10,83,239,152,85,72,246,225,110,212,116,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
