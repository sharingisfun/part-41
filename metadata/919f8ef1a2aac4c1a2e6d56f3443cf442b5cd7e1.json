Having previously \nworked together in Gate XIII when Shonagh performed vocals on one track of \ntheir 2012 EP Once Upon a Time and acted as Lead vocalist in the following live \nshows, they decided to start a band playing Symphonic Metal that would fit well \nin a live environment. \n\nThey quickly finished their first EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Among the FrozenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was released \nJuly 16th 2013. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Among the FrozenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has already been seeing good success with \na number of tracks receiving airplay both internationally and locally with \ncoverage of the release coming from all corners of the world drawing favourable \ncomparisons with bands such as Nightwish, Sonata Arctica, and Evanescance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:919f8ef1a2aac4c1a2e6d56f3443cf442b5cd7e1","amp;dn":"Selene+-+Among+the+Frozen+%282013+Symphonic+Metal%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"919f8ef1a2aac4c1a2e6d56f3443cf442b5cd7e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,159,142,241,162,170,196,193,162,230,213,111,52,67,207,68,43,92,215,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
