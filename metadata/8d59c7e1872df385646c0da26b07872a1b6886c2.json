After recording the Short Back 'n' Sides album, Mick Ronson decided he was sick of touring, so Ian toured instead with Robbie Alter on guitar (tho' Mick would eventually deputise for Tommy Mandel on keyboards when he became ill). This concert was recorded in 1981 at the Dr Pepper Festival at Pier 84, New York City. It was originally recorded for MTV (before they went on air!), and I believe was released commercially in 1983 (tho' I didn't see it in the UK until 1989), and was issued on laserdisc (in Japan only?) in 1989.\n\nOnce Bitten Twice Shy \nGun Control \nCentral Park 'n' West \nAll The Way From Memphis \nI Need Your Love \nNoises \nJust Another Night \nCleveland Rocks \nIrene Wilde \nAll The Young Dudes \n\nuploaded by zannick","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d59c7e1872df385646c0da26b07872a1b6886c2","amp;dn":"Ian+Hunter+Rocks+1981","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d59c7e1872df385646c0da26b07872a1b6886c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,89,199,225,135,45,243,133,100,108,13,162,107,7,135,42,27,104,134,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
