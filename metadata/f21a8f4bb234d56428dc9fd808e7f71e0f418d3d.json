To up the\nante, the trio now released two live CDs, with some of the material coming from\nthese studio recordings, and they are as good, no less could be expected from\nthem. On both CDs JÃƒÂ¶rgensmann plays the basset clarinet, which allows for the\nplaying of additional notes in the lower range. One CD was recorded at the now\nbecoming famous Alchemia club in Krakow, Poland, in May 2006, and the other one\nin Poznan, Poland in March 2006. One might question the value of two live CDs\nwith the same band, recorded in such a short time frame and with overlapping\nmaterial : &quot;Perrata&quot;, &quot;Giuffree&quot;, &quot;Menace&quot;, pieces accounting for half the\nlength of both records, but since the 12 CD release of the Vandermark 5 at\nAlchemia, this kind of questions has become irrelevant, because the performance\nis what counts, on an equal level with the material, and believe me, both CDs\nare really worth listening to. And there are differences : &quot;Menace&quot; clocks in\nat 19 minutes on the Alchemia performance, while only at nine minutes in\nPoznan, just to demonstrate that the trio plays as the moment tells them\nto. JÃƒÂ¶rgensmann's playing is abstract but fluid, melodic and soulful, free and\nanchored in the tradition. He can play deliriously long high speed phrases, but\nalso enjoy slow, bluesy and yearning moments as on &quot;Giuffree&quot;, his hommage to\nJimmy Giuffre, one of the icons of the jazz clarinet. And the Oles brothers?\nWell, what can I say more than what I wrote before? They are one of the best\nrhythm sections around : sensitive, innovative, intrinsically musical and\nfree. One a treat for the ear, the other a pleasure to hear, and vice versa. If\nI had to choose one of the two albums, I would go for the Fennomedia release,\nbecause of the absolutely impeccable sound quality, giving the live performance\nan even more direct feel, as if you are part of the audience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f21a8f4bb234d56428dc9fd808e7f71e0f418d3d","amp;dn":"Theo+Jorgensmann%2C+Marcin+Oles%2C+Bartlomiej+Brat+Oles+-+Live+in+Po","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f21a8f4bb234d56428dc9fd808e7f71e0f418d3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,26,143,75,178,52,213,100,40,220,159,216,8,231,247,30,15,65,141,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
