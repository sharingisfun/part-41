The game breaks from the norm of RTS adventures with its humorous story mode and multiplayer bouts for up to 8 players.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f88bca0607603849562b9618979f23df2a7b71","amp;dn":"Knight+Shift","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3f88bca0607603849562b9618979f23df2a7b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,248,139,202,6,7,96,56,73,86,43,150,24,151,159,35,223,42,123,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
