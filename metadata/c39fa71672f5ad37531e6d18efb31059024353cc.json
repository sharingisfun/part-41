Edward Scales is a businessman, a butterfly collector, a respectable man. He is the man Gwen Carrick fell in love with one windswept day on a beach in Cornwall. Seven years later he is dead and Gwen is on trial for his murder.\n\nFrom country house drawing rooms to the rainforests of Brazil, The Specimen explores the price one independent young woman might pay for wanting an unorthodox life.\n\nSet in a Victorian world battling between the forces of spiritualism and Darwinism, polite society and the call of clandestine love, Gwen and Edward's tale is a gripping melodrama, a romance and a murder mystery that will compel readers to its final thrilling page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39fa71672f5ad37531e6d18efb31059024353cc","amp;dn":"The+Specimen+-+Martha+Lea.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39fa71672f5ad37531e6d18efb31059024353cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,159,167,22,114,245,173,55,83,30,109,24,239,179,16,89,2,67,83,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
