Torn with guilt \n\nthat he may be responsible, Page returns home to discover that his wife, Tori, has \n\ndisappeared. Frantic, Page follows her trail to Rostov, a remote town in Texas \n\nfamous for a massive astronomical observatory, a long-abandoned military base, and \n\nunexplained night time phenomena that draw onlookers from every corner of the\n\nglobe. Many of these gawkers, Tori among them, are compelled to visit this tiny \n\ncommunity to witness the mysterious Rostov Lights.\n\n\nWithout warning, a gunman begins firing on the lights, screaming &quot;Go back to hell \n\nwhere you came from&quot;, then turns his rifle on the bystanders. A bloodbath ensues, \n\nand events quickly spiral out of control, setting the stage for even greater \n\nviolence and death.\n\n\nPage must solve the mystery of the Rostov Lights to save his wife. In the process, \n\nhe learns that the decaying military base may not be abandoned at all, and that \n\nthe government may have known about the lights for decades. \n\n\nCould these phenomena be more dangerous than anyone could have possibly imagined?\n\n\n\n\n               **********************************************\n\n\n\nIf you enjoy listening to Audiobooks leave a comment and let me know.\n\nIf there is something you would like to listen to then perhaps I can accomodate as\n\nI have access to a library of Audiobooks.\n\n\nCheers...Fingers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf723715f0b72693fc2799724e62a8df7b90b5c","amp;dn":"The+Shimmer+-+David+Morrell+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf723715f0b72693fc2799724e62a8df7b90b5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,247,35,113,95,11,114,105,63,194,121,151,36,230,42,141,247,185,11,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
