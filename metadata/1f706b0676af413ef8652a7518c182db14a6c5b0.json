In an effort to come to terms with this tragedy he visits an old colleague, Bob Moore, who is subsequently murdered. The quest to catch the killer centres around a group of Moores psychologically disturbed patients, however equally as important is an affair which develops between Capa and the mysterious Rose. This relationship, at first a diversion, becomes central to the plot as the film progresses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f706b0676af413ef8652a7518c182db14a6c5b0","amp;dn":"Color+of+night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f706b0676af413ef8652a7518c182db14a6c5b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,112,107,6,118,175,65,62,248,101,42,117,24,193,130,219,20,166,197,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
