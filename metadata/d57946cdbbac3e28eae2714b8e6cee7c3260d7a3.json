Paradise\n\n\nWhite Moth Black Butterfly (WMBB) is the 'experimental' creation of UK singer / songwriter Daniel Tompkins (In Colour, Skyharbor, Ex-TesseracT) With influences stemming from the likes of Massive Attack, Enigma, and Sigur Ros, this new musical endeavor of DanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s is to be taken live following the release of the debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœOne Thousand WingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in November. The live line-up will consist of Keshav Dhar (Guitars, electronics) Chris Haywood (Bass/Contrabass) Ben Ansaldo (Drums) and Dan (Vocals). The project offers endless unique line-ups in the live arena, and will hopefully be a USP for the band when it comes to touring in various territories, allowing for different musicians to contribute something exceptional to the live performance.\n\nWithin Ã¢â‚¬ËœOne Thousand WingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, DanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting abilities, accompanied with contributions from Acle Kahney (TesseracT), Keshav Dhar (Skyharbor), and Ben Ansaldo emanate huge cinematic soundscapes, juxtaposed with classically and electronically vibed songs, nested with powerful vocals that are quite comparative to that of his other projects.\n\nThe album has guest vocals from Hayley Martin of Ã¢â‚¬ËœShadowboxerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and singer/songwriter Jordan Bethany.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57946cdbbac3e28eae2714b8e6cee7c3260d7a3","amp;dn":"White+Moth+Black+Butterfly+-+One+Thousand+Wings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57946cdbbac3e28eae2714b8e6cee7c3260d7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,121,70,205,187,172,62,40,234,226,113,75,142,108,238,124,50,96,215,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
