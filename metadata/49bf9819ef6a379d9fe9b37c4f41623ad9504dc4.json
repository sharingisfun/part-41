The originator of the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; production technique, Spector was a pioneer of the 1960s girl group sound and produced over 25 Top 40 hits between 1960 and 1965. Later in his career he worked with artists including Ike and Tina Turner, John Lennon, George Harrison, and the Ramones with similar success.\nHe produced the Beatles' Academy Award-winning album, Let It Be, and the Grammy Award-winning Concert for Bangladesh by former Beatle George Harrison. In 1989, Spector was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a non-performer. The 1965 song &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'&quot;, produced and co-written by Spector for The Righteous Brothers, is listed by BMI as the song with the most U.S. airplay in the 20th century. \nThe 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson in his Alhambra, California home led to his being charged with murder in the second degree. After a 2007 mistrial, he was convicted in 2009, and given a prison sentence of 19 years to life. \n\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49bf9819ef6a379d9fe9b37c4f41623ad9504dc4","amp;dn":"Phil+Spector-Early+Productions+58-62-1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49bf9819ef6a379d9fe9b37c4f41623ad9504dc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,191,152,25,239,106,55,157,159,233,179,124,79,65,98,58,217,80,77,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
