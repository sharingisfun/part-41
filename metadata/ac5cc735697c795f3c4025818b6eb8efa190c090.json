Hashem has always been horrified that the man his sister loves is black, and one day his anger erupts in an outburst of violence that puts Malek in a coma.\n\nAs Leen waits by Malek's bed, she reflects on their love affair and her life as an unmarried, childless woman; an anomaly, in a country like hers. The story is juxtaposed with the unfolding of the Iraq war; another needless conflict.\n\nFull of poetry, from ancient odes, elegies and prayers to the lyricism in the characters' language, Days of Ignorance is a tough, unforgettable and modern portrait of Saudi life.\n\nThe original Arabic version of the title refers to an Islamic concept of &quot;ignorance of divine guidance&quot; or &quot;Days of Ignorance&quot; referring to the condition in which Arabs found themselves in pre-Islamic Arabia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac5cc735697c795f3c4025818b6eb8efa190c090","amp;dn":"Days+of+Ignorance+by+Laila+Aljohani+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac5cc735697c795f3c4025818b6eb8efa190c090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,92,199,53,105,124,121,95,60,64,37,129,139,110,184,239,161,144,192,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
