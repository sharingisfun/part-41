Kaguya decides to return to her first dimension while she replenishes her chakra, but when Naruto tries to use his abilities to save Obito, Black Zetsu launches a tirade not only about Naruto's futile efforts, but what he believes to be Obito's wasted life; and though Obito agrees to this, Zetsu's words do nothing but infuriate the touring Uzumaki. Wasting no time when he realised that his dÃ…ï¿½jutsu's ability was useable once more, Sasuke launches an attack on Kaguya, forcing her to shift dimensions once more to narrowly escape the attack. Noting that this time he would be the distraction, Sasuke engages Kaguya giving her no time to relent as he dons his Perfect Susanoo and flies towards her.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:218ceb88218cff2838ccff971e9432e2e54c07e5","amp;dn":"+Naruto+Shippuden+Manga+687+%5BI+Know+You+Will%5D+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"218ceb88218cff2838ccff971e9432e2e54c07e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,140,235,136,33,140,255,40,56,204,255,151,30,148,50,226,229,76,7,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
