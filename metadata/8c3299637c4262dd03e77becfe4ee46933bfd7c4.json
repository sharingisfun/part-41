Discovered in the Archives of The Jim Henson Company, Tale of Sand is an original graphic novel adaptation of an unproduced, feature-length screenplay written by Jim Henson and his frequent writing partner, Jerry Juhl. \n\nProduced under the complete supervision of Henson Company CEO Lisa Henson, Tale of Sand will allow Henson fans to recognize some of the inspirations and set pieces that appeared in later Henson Company productions.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - The Last Zombie - The End (#001-005):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9251016&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9251016&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - Medal of Honor - Soundtrack Collection LE (8CD):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9246180&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9246180&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! ** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3299637c4262dd03e77becfe4ee46933bfd7c4","amp;dn":"Tale+of+Sand+%7C+%28Jim+Henson%29+%5BGN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3299637c4262dd03e77becfe4ee46933bfd7c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,50,153,99,124,66,98,221,3,231,123,236,254,78,228,105,51,191,215,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
