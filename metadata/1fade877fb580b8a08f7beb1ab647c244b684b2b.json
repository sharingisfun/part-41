To mark his 60th birthday, we follow Rattle through a demanding year of rehearsals and performances with five different orchestras, from the South Bank to Taiwan, as he talks candidly about his life and beliefs. Through the lens of archive footage, we explore a remarkable journey spanning four decades, from his early days with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at the tender age of 22 to his current post as chief conductor and artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic. There are contributions from artists and friends who have worked closely with him, including violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, composer Thomas Ades, singers Roderick Williams and Mark Padmore, theatre director Peter Sellars and the managing director of the Barbican, Sir Nicholas Kenyon.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f7/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4b/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Simon-Rattle-The-Making-of-a-Maestro-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3138Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160Kbps ABR 48KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.35 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02h9fvl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fade877fb580b8a08f7beb1ab647c244b684b2b","amp;dn":"BBC+Simon+Rattle+The+Making+of+a+Maestro+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fade877fb580b8a08f7beb1ab647c244b684b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,173,232,119,251,88,11,138,8,247,190,177,171,100,124,36,75,104,75,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
