Robert SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songwriting is so etheral and yet totally structured. We never would have related the two bands to one another but if you listen through all of My Bloody ValentineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s layers the inspiration is clear. Of the long list of bands inspired by MBV, us included, a lot of the credit really needs to go to the Cure. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Joy Zipper\n\nSometimes we, the members of Kitty Karlyle, try to imagine what it would have been like if we went to high school with Robert Smith. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not sure if he would have wanted to be our friend, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a safe bet we would have sat at the same lunch table. Back in the day, our Cure albums were sacred objects. They taught us to embrace our disaffection, our alienation, our despair. They celebrated everything that was good about everything that was bad. And no song in the Cure catalogue so perfectly typified the light-from-darkness ethos as In Between Days. Robert wanted to die! He shivered like a child! He pleaded with a lost lover to come back, come back, come back to him! And yetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ as those synthesizers wrapped their loving arms around you, and the guitars bounced off your bedroom walls, you couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but feel like it was your lucky day. For three perfect minutes, you could stop sobbing into your pillow, and dance on your bed. Excuse usÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ our mascara is running. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kitty Karlyle\n\nThe oeuvre of The Cure is, to me, the musical equivalent of the Encyclopedia Britannica ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an amazing reference tool for researching the myriad ways one can approach the task of constructing a flawless, unique, hooky, synth-based pop song, over and over and over. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the hilariously vibrant, catchy tunes, and then the gorgeous ones that haunt. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all just so good. Anyone who tells you that Robert Smith is not a complete genius is a stick-in-the-mud. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Violet Clark\n\nWe chose A Strange Day because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an awesome song, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not one of the Hits. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just obscure enough to have allowed us to come out of left field a bit, and to represent a lesser-known period in the CureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career for the tribute record. We really had fun reinventing the song and being playful without the self-consciousness one might encounter when messing with the iconic quality of some of the more well-known songs.
