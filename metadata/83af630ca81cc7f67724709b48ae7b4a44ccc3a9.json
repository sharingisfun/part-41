The hidden song that was previously after &quot;18th Floor Balcony&quot; is now at the end of the last track instead.  The second disc of this re-release is labelled as &quot;Teach Your Baby Well Live&quot; and is, as it suggests, a live album.  Good stuff.\n\nAll files were ripped by me from the original CDs, directly to FLAC.\n\nHope you all like it, and seeds are always appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT:  I found the Hate Me single/EP disc that I'd missed when I went on this ripping spree.  It's now ripped, and uploaded separately, right here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4960900&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4960900&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83af630ca81cc7f67724709b48ae7b4a44ccc3a9","amp;dn":"Blue+October+discography+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83af630ca81cc7f67724709b48ae7b4a44ccc3a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,175,99,12,168,28,199,246,119,36,112,155,72,174,123,74,68,204,195,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
