Neuroscientist Dean Haycock examines the behavior of real life psychopaths and discusses how their actions can be explained in scientific terms, from research that literally looks inside their brains to understanding how psychopaths, without empathy but very goal-oriented, think and act the way they do. Some don't commit crimes at all, but rather make use of their skills in the boardroom.\n\nBut what does this mean for lawyers, judges, psychiatrists, victims, and readersÃ¢â‚¬â€for anyone who has ever wondered how some people can be so bad. Could your nine-year-old be a psychopath? What about your co-worker?
