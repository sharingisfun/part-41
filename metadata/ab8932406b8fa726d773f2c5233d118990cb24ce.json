While it was not a box office success (coming at a time when audiences were looking for a new generation of action hero), &quot;Malone&quot; did well on home video and cable television and has become something of a cult item over the last two decades since it&amp;#039;s release. &quot;Malone&quot; has an extremely devoted fanbase and most critics and fans agree that Reynolds gives one of his greatest performances as the title character. The script is derivative of &quot;Shane&quot;, but the reinvention works very well.\n\nAfter the VHS went out of print in the early &amp;#039;90&amp;#039;s, &quot;Malone&quot; has been bewilderingly \nunavailable. It shows up only rarely on television and has never seen a dvd release in the United States or most other countries. Apparently Image Entertainment (but\nmore likely a high-quality pirate company) transferred a good-condition VHS copy onto dvd somewhere, which is what this torrent is. The quality is very good and it&amp;#039;s nice to have &quot;Malone&quot; in any case. \n\nRegion 0 encoding.\n\nEnjoy.\nAnd please seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab8932406b8fa726d773f2c5233d118990cb24ce","amp;dn":"MALONE+%281987%2C+Burt+Reynolds%2C+rated+R%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab8932406b8fa726d773f2c5233d118990cb24ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,137,50,64,107,143,167,38,215,115,242,197,35,61,17,137,144,203,36,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
