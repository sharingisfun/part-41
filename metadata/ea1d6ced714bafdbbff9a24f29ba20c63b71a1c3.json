The foremost goal in making this movie is to educate and enlighten audiences with the story of this car, its place in history and in the larger story of our car culture and how it enables our continuing addiction to foreign oil. This is an important film with an important message that not only calls to task the officials who squelched the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, but all of the other accomplices, government, the car companies, Big Oil, even Eco-darling Hydrogen as well as consumers, who turned their backs on the car and embracing instead the SUV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea1d6ced714bafdbbff9a24f29ba20c63b71a1c3","amp;dn":"Who+killed+the+Electric+Car%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea1d6ced714bafdbbff9a24f29ba20c63b71a1c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,29,108,237,113,75,175,219,191,249,162,79,41,186,32,198,59,113,161,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
