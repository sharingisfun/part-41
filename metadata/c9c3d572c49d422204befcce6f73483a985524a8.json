A leading man who is in many ways as tragic as he is heroic,\nand who passionately believes in upholding his dearest values, primarily\nthe presumption of innocence and the sport of verbal jousting with judges\nand the prosecution.\n\nIn this book's six stories (subsequently serialised for television as season 1\nof &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;), we follow selected trials from Rumpole's career,\naided and abetted by a supporting cast of very British oddballs.\nThese range from his formidable wife Hilda (aka She Who Must Be Obeyed)\nto the utterly ineffectual Guthrie Featherstone QC, his head of Chambers,\ntaking in beautifully drawn caricatures of judges, lawyers, clients\nand criminals based on people from Mortimer's real-life courtroom experiences.\n\nYou don't need to be an expert in law - or even have much of an interest in the\nBritish justice system - to appreciate this book. More than anything, these are\nquirky, human tales of a man who consistently champions the cause of the\n(allegedly) criminal underdog, being equal parts barrister-at-law, detective\nand courtroom entertainer, who encounters a never-ending variety of odd people\nand situations in the course of plying his trade.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mortimer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mortimer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumpole_of_the_Bailey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumpole_of_the_Bailey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thrillingdetective.com/eyes/rumpole.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thrillingdetective.com/eyes/rumpole.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c3d572c49d422204befcce6f73483a985524a8","amp;dn":"Rumpole+of+the+Bailey+-+John+Mortimer++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c3d572c49d422204befcce6f73483a985524a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,195,213,114,196,157,66,34,4,190,252,206,111,115,72,58,152,85,36,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
