So this is a torrent of the torrent. If someone can upload properly, please do. Original magnet link follows - much easier than downloading this torrent file first:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA hacker claims to have hacked a network of the surveillance technology company Gamma International and has published 40 gigabytes of internal data. A Twitter account has published release notes, price lists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and source code. Malware researchers and human rights activists welcome the publication, Gamma itself refuses to comment.\n\nThis is an english adaption of two German articles. Thanks to Anna and Kilian for their help on the translation.\n\nYesterday, we reported that the Twitter account @GammaGroupPR is publishing internal documents of the offensive computer intrusion product suite FinFisher/FinSpy, developed by Gamma and marketed and sold to state actors around the world. A post on reddit with the same username claims:\n\n    [Ã¢â‚¬Â¦] a couple days ago when I hacked in and made off with 40GB of data from GammaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s networks. I have hard proof they knew they were selling (and still are) to people using their software to attack Bahraini activists, along with a whole lot of other stuff in that 40GB.\n\n    HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a torrent of all the data. Please download and seed. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a twitter feed where IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m posting some of the interesting stuff I find in there, starting off slow to build up rather than just publish all the worst shit at once. \n\nIf this Tweet is accurate, the hacked server is finsupport.finfisher.com, but it was since taken down.\n\nUnfortunately, the Dropbox-accuont with the original Torrent-file is Ã¢â‚¬Å“temporarily disabledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\n\nRelated torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10712625/FinFisher_unzip.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10712625/FinFisher_unzip.zip&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9528243/FinFisher_GSM.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9528243/FinFisher_GSM.zip&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe99d0d439bfbd3d14045fe82a4cef39142a5e21","amp;dn":"Gamma+Finfisher+Hacker+Loot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe99d0d439bfbd3d14045fe82a4cef39142a5e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,153,208,212,57,191,189,61,20,4,95,232,42,76,239,57,20,42,94,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
