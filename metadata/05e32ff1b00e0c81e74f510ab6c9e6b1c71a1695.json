Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals risk everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. \n\nThe biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created and now packed with layers of new detail, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three lead characters, playing all sides of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interwoven story. \n\nGrand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, the ever-evolving Grand Theft Auto universe. Explore the vast world or rise through the criminal ranks by banding together to complete Jobs for cash, purchase properties, vehicles and character upgrades, compete in traditional competitive modes, or create new content to play and share with the Grand Theft Auto community. \n\nAll new content and gameplay created and released since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online including new Jobs, an arsenal of new weapons, scores of new vehicles, new properties and player customizations will also be available in Grand Theft Auto Online for PC. In addition, the current community of players will have the ability to transfer their Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to their choice of PlayStationÃ‚Â®4, Xbox One or PC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05e32ff1b00e0c81e74f510ab6c9e6b1c71a1695","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+V+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05e32ff1b00e0c81e74f510ab6c9e6b1c71a1695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,227,47,241,176,14,12,129,231,79,81,10,182,201,230,177,199,26,22,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
