Kat works at the Daily Bugle, and dealt with major Bugle employees Betty Brant, Ben Urich, Robbie Robertson, and J. Jonah Jameson. \n\nThe series was written by Bill Rosemann and Guy Davis, with covers by Greg Horn.\n\nA precursor to The Pulse (a series which also featured Kat as a character), the story focuses on a journalist whose career is centered on super powered beings (much to Kat's chagrin).\n\nThis torrent contains the entire mini-series in one cbz file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3716425140767801abf733200a9687947062e083","amp;dn":"Deadline+TPB+%28Marvel+Comics+-+by+Guy+Davis+and+Bill+Rosemann%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3716425140767801abf733200a9687947062e083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,22,66,81,64,118,120,1,171,247,51,32,10,150,135,148,112,98,224,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
