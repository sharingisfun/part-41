The band's rise was indebted to the aggressive rap-rock movement made popular by the likes of Korn and Limp Bizkit, a movement that paired grunge's alienation with a bold, buzzing soundtrack. Linkin Park added a unique spin to that formula, however, focusing as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda as the band's muscled instrumentation, which layered DJ effects atop heavy, processed guitars. While the group's sales never eclipsed those of its tremendously successful debut, Hybrid Theory, few alt-metal bands rivaled Linkin Park during the band's heyday.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner\nCatalog:\t\t9362-49504-8\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.83% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Lost In The Echo\n02.In My Remains\n03.Burn It Down\n04.Lies Greed Misery\n05.I'll Be Gone\n06.Castle Of Glass\n07.Victimized\n08.Roads Untraveled\n09.Skin To Bone\n10.Until It Breaks\n11.Tinfoil\n12.Powerless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed****\n\n                    ****Seedbox Owners Please Add Me****\n                               \n                               ****Thanks****\n\n\n                           ****Props To BriBerY***\n\n\n                               ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:949cc726b1f10ce8ac1cabbea9bd64dcaafea639","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Living+Things+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"949cc726b1f10ce8ac1cabbea9bd64dcaafea639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,156,199,38,177,241,12,232,172,28,171,190,169,189,100,220,170,254,166,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
