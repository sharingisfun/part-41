We watch an explanation video from a Ã¢â‚¬Å“cum eater,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ talk about men versus women in the workplace, and see a clip from C-SPAN trying to rationalize a fence jumper at the White House. Ant chats about the way the media sensationalizes news to trigger public panic, we learn about the first Ebola diagnosis in the US, and hear a few Ã¢â‚¬Å“teasersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of what events will be coming up on TACS. Ant goes over a story about another good looking teacher going to prison for fucking a student and then a one regarding young kids learning about sex in school. We wrap up the show by looking at a god damn adorable picture of Anthony from kindergarten, musing over some childhood naughtiness, wishing shitty Al Sharpton a happy 60th birthday, and hearing about Michael Phelps and Amanda Bynes getting DUIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd491b62481043d2ed746ab9c96f24966fe4682a","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-30+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd491b62481043d2ed746ab9c96f24966fe4682a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,73,27,98,72,16,67,210,237,116,106,185,201,111,36,150,111,228,104,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
