Their debut full-length, Phantoms, attempts to translate their kinetic live act for the home listening experience. Rubicon opens the album with a riff that borders on math rock but breaks into vocals that are undeniably pop, with an airy chorus ensconced in reverb. It sets a great pace for the disc.  Lauren Larsons singing style and dissonant chord progressions have earned Ume comparisons to Sonic Youth; on Phantoms, Built to Spill by way of Don Caballero seems more appropriate.\n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n \n 1.
