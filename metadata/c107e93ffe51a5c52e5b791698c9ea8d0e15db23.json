It was released to Radio Disney on July 2, 2010 as promotion for the fourth season of Hannah Montana. The song is musically country pop based. Lyrically, the track speaks about how Hannah Montana might be famous, but she is just an ordinary girl underneath. The song was later released on July 6, 2010 through digital distribution as the lead single from the soundtrack of the same title as the special title (Hannah Montana Forever) of the fourth and final season of the series.\n\nUnlike other Hannah Montana music videos, &quot;Ordinary Girl&quot; is not a concert taping performance. Hannah in the video is also a model, and not Miley Cyrus. It premiered on July 2, 2010 and starts out in Montana's dressing room where she is getting ready for a concert. She uses her video camera to tape everything that goes on, leading up to her stepping onstage, where a screaming crowd is waiting. She waves, then hands the camera to a girl in the front row of the concert. The video then flashes to a school room where the girl has a party with her friends after receiving the camera, while older shots from the Hannah Montana season 3 concert are playing on the white boards. The camera is then passed onto another girl who bumps into a boy who begins talking to the girl. Also Hannah's face is never shown in the video.\n\n&quot;Ordinary Girl&quot; was written by Toby Gad and Arama Brown. It was released on July 2, 2010 to Radio Disney, then on July 6, 2010 to all digital stores. It is featured in the second episode of Hannah Montana Forever (final season), &quot;Hannah Montana to the Principal's Office&quot;.\n\nStephanie Bruzzese of CommonSenseMedia stated that the song's &quot;solid, snappy guitar hook is backed by catchy percussive clapping and a chorus of cute young voices -- a set-up that sounds more suited to Miley's maturing vocals.&quot;\n\nThe song debuted at ninety-eight on the US Hot Digital Songs chart for the week ending July 11, 2010, then peaked at #49 two weeks later. The song has also debuted at #91 on Billboard's US Hot 100 on the week dated July 31, 2010. It spent two weeks at its peak, then fell off the chart. It even reached #2 on the Radio Disney Top 30 Countdown, where it stayed for 3 weeks.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c107e93ffe51a5c52e5b791698c9ea8d0e15db23","amp;dn":"Hannah+Montana+-+Ordinary+Girl+%28mp4-2nafish%291080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c107e93ffe51a5c52e5b791698c9ea8d0e15db23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,7,233,63,254,81,165,197,46,91,121,22,152,201,234,141,14,21,219,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
