Set in an obviously advanced but anonymous country, the young, unemployed man (Darie Lurie) gets the atomic bomb after it is stolen by a group of gangsters. He is not quite sure what to do with it and after meeting and romancing an attractive women, and being chased by the government and the gangsters both, he decides to hand out a bit of the bomb to any citizen who wants it. With these pieces of wondrous radioactivity, people are able to dart around without the need for wheeled conveyances or they can grow crops in quite a miraculous manner. This drollery owes its effectiveness, in large part, to director Gopo's acclaimed successes with animated short films. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide\n\n   General\n      Complete name : S-a furat o bomba.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 894 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 12mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 728 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 12mn\n      Bit rate : 1 584 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.206\n      Stream size : 819 MiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 12mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 132 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 68.1 MiB (8%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 440 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0131571\n\nNo dialogues; no subtitles needed\n\nPosted originally at KG by TheBlackCrispinGlover","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7074c06064defe11576c002b016128161f0c858","amp;dn":"Popescu-Gopo+-+S-a+furat+o+bomba+%5B1961%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7074c06064defe11576c002b016128161f0c858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,7,76,6,6,77,239,225,21,118,192,2,176,22,18,129,97,240,200,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
