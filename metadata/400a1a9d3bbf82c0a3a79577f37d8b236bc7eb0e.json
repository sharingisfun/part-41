The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a pinata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish.\n\n Michael Lewis's investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so brilliantly, sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, DC, we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the reckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400a1a9d3bbf82c0a3a79577f37d8b236bc7eb0e","amp;dn":"Boomerang+Travels+In+The+New+Third+World+by+Michael+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400a1a9d3bbf82c0a3a79577f37d8b236bc7eb0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,10,26,157,59,191,130,192,163,167,149,119,243,125,139,35,107,199,235,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
