It's a hot mashup of new and old! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this land with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and quest for his lost beloved. He wields a Shovel Blade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\nBut, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost. If you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, humor and levity, and real heartÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Shovel Knight is for you!\nShovel KnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautifully authentic style bridges the gap between yesterday and today. Design, art, and audio hearken back to the days of 8-bit.\nAmazing soundtrack from Jake Kaufman and Manami Matsumae, best known for scoring the original Mega Man.\nCrazy bosses and lovable characters showcase a light touch to narrative with humor and levity.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: OS: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.1 ghz or equivalent Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: 2nd Generation Intel Core HD Graphics (2000/3000), 256MB DirectX: Version 9.0c Hard Drive: 200 MB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b40b59cbcae76b0c8798be63d66caaf59ce1c305","amp;dn":"Shovel+Knight+%282.8.0.15%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b40b59cbcae76b0c8798be63d66caaf59ce1c305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,11,89,203,202,231,107,12,135,152,190,99,214,108,170,245,156,225,195,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
