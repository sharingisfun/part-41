Their sound was more radio-friendly than that of HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sker DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼, though with similarly dark and introspective undertones.\n\nTheir first live show was February 20, 1992, at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, GA, after a few weeks warming up in R.E.M.'s downtown practice space. It was a &quot;secret&quot; show, not advertised in the local media, bumping Athens band Roosevelt from headliner to opener. Word got out and the club was packed.\n\nLater in 1992, the band released the album Copper Blue, which was named Album Of The Year 1992 by the NME. The following year they released Beaster, an EP of darker material recorded during the Copper Blue sessions. The single &quot;If I Can't Change Your Mind&quot; was a moderate UK hit.\n\nAfter a first abortive attempt to record a second full-length album, the band regrouped and recorded File Under: Easy Listening quickly in the spring of 1994 and released it that fall.This album reached number 7 in the U.K. album charts.\n\nA B-side collection, Besides, followed in 1995. Mould broke the band up later that year because Barbe wished to spend more time with his growing family and expand his solo career. Travis then took over the drumming slot in the band Kustomized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopper Blue 1992\n\n\nCopper Blue was the debut album of the US alternative rock band Sugar. It was voted 1992 Album of the Year by the NME. All of the songs were written by guitarist/vocalist Bob Mould, who also co-produced with Lou Giordano. The song &quot;The Slim&quot; is about losing someone to AIDS. Musically, the band continues the thick punk guitar of Mould's other band, HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sker DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼, while slowing the tempo and emphasizing melody even more.\n\nA limited edition initial run of the CD was released by Rykodisc in a front-and-back metal copper sleeve with each of the 2,500 copies containing a one-of-a-kind Polaroid photo taken by one of the three band members and stamped on the back with &quot;Sugar Copper Blue Summer '92.&quot;\n\nSeveral tracks were recorded for this album, but were not included. Mould decided to release them separately as an EP entitled Beaster.\n\nIn 2006, the band Train featured a cover of &quot;If I Can't Change Your Mind&quot; on its For Me, It's You album.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Act We Act&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n2.\t&quot;A Good Idea&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n3.\t&quot;Changes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n4.\t&quot;Helpless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n5.\t&quot;Hoover Dam&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n6.\t&quot;The Slim&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n7.\t&quot;If I Can't Change Your Mind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n8.\t&quot;Fortune Teller&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n9.\t&quot;Slick&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59\n10.\t&quot;Man on the Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeaster 1993\n\n\n\nBeaster was Sugar's 1993 EP. The songs were recorded at the same time as the band's acclaimed first album, Copper Blue, however, it has a much denser, heavier sound than that record. The EP is a loosely conceptual work built around dark religious imagery.\n\n&quot;JC Auto&quot; is short for &quot;Jesus Christ Autobiography.&quot; The Judas Cradle, also known as the Judas Chair, was a torture device allegedly used by the Spanish Inquisition.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Come Around&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n2.\t&quot;Tilted&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n3.\t&quot;Judas Cradle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:15\n4.\t&quot;JC Auto&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:13\n5.\t&quot;Feeling Better&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:22\n6.\t&quot;Walking Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Under: Easy Listening 1994\n\n\n\nFile Under: Easy Listening (also known as F.U.E.L.) is a 1994 album by Sugar. The song &quot;Company Book&quot; was written by bassist David Barbe; everything else was written by primary songwriter Bob Mould. F.U.E.L. was the last studio album released by Sugar.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Gift&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n2.\t&quot;Company Book&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n3.\t&quot;Your Favorite Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n4.\t&quot;What You Want It to Be&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n5.\t&quot;Gee Angel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n6.\t&quot;Panama City Motel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n7.\t&quot;Can't Help You Anymore&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n8.\t&quot;Granny Cool&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n9.\t&quot;Believe What You're Saying&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n10.\t&quot;Explode and Make Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGee Angel 1995\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nGee Angel\nExplode And Make Up\nThe Slim\nAfter All The Roads Have Led To Nowhere\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Mould  1996\n\n\nBob Mould was the third solo album by former HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sker DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ and Sugar vocalist Bob Mould. It was recorded between September &amp; October 1995, mixed and mastered November 1995, and released in April 1996. He wrote and performed all instruments on the album, and the album's sleeve notes declare, &quot;This one is for me.&quot; In the place of traditional band credits, the sleeve also reads &quot;Bob Mould is Bob Mould.&quot; The song &quot;Dog on Fire,&quot; which was chosen to be the theme song of The Daily Show, was originally written for this album.
