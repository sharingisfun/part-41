Since wowing audiences in Australia, LA, New York, and Texas for SXSW, COYH have ignited frenzied audiences on a global level, even stopping by to record a BBC live session. Finally, You &amp; I is polished and ready to rock. Their 2007 EP Blue on Blue (produced by Bernard Butler) received massive support and the new single 'Expectations' is receiving the same amount of love. You can be assured, with Bernard Butler once again enlisted for production duties, there are great `expectations' for this album! Speak N Spell.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad47774f52f0f47c878ae66c1f6952eac2b4e97","amp;dn":"Cut+Off+Your+Hands+-+You+And+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad47774f52f0f47c878ae66c1f6952eac2b4e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,212,119,116,245,47,15,71,200,120,174,102,193,246,149,46,172,43,78,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
