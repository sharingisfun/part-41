In the opening episode, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) abandons her &quot;Mr. Potato Head&quot; spouse at the altar and moves in with her former high-school friend Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) in Monica's spacious New York loft apartment. Not long afterward, we meet Monica's brother, Ross (David Schwimmer), who is down in the dumps because his ex-wife, Carol (Jane Sibbett), has not only declared herself a lesbian, but will soon be giving birth to his son (named Ben), whom she and her partner intend to raise without any of Ross' help. Also, we are treated to the first of aspiring actor Joey Tribbiani's (Matt LeBlanc) dead-end &quot;big breaks&quot; when he is hired as Al Pacino's stand-in. Finally, airhead Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) is given the opportunity to perform her treacly folk songs at the gang's favorite hangout, the Central Perk coffeehouse -- only to have her debut spoiled by a citywide power blackout. In other developments, Ross &quot;adopts&quot; a monkey named Marcel; Joey briefly falls for Phoebe's bitchy twin sister, Ursula (also played by Lisa Kudrow); and Joey's roommate, Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), betrays a confidence by informing Rachel that Ross has a crush on her. A solid hit from the moment it left the starting gate, Friends wound up its freshman season as the eighth highest-rated program on American television. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nSee All Friends: Season 01 Trailers and Clips\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 587 mins \nComplete Cast of Friends: Season 01\nJennifer Aniston - Rachel Green\nDavid Schwimmer - Ross Geller\nMatt LeBlanc - Joey Tribbiani\nCourteney Cox - Monica Geller\nMatthew Perry - Chandler Bing\nLisa Kudrow - Phoebe Buffay\n\n\nCategories:Television, Comedy\nFormat: DVD  \nRelease Date: 04/30/2002\nTV Rating: NR\nRunning Time: 587 min\nNumber of Discs: 4(3 of 4)\nLanguage: Eng\nSubTitles: Eng/Fre/Spa/KO\nView special edition features View special edition featuresLimited Edition Features:\nPilot episode producers' commentary\nA Peek at Central Perk: interactive map\n&quot;Friends of Friends&quot;: Memorable guest-star moments\n&quot;How Well Do You Know Your Friends?&quot; trivia quiz\n&quot;The One With the Trailer of Season Two&quot;\nSoundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.0\nInteractive menus\nCast career highlights\nSubtitles: English, FranÃƒÂ§ais, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, &amp; Korean\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb958da3c5a8a0e2a2c5e3ffb4280f066b9dec71","amp;dn":"Friends+-+Seasn+1+-+Disc+3+-+DVDRip+-+NTSC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb958da3c5a8a0e2a2c5e3ffb4280f066b9dec71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,149,141,163,197,168,160,226,162,197,227,255,180,40,15,6,107,157,236,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
