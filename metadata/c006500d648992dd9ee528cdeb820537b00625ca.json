With loving care the book recreates vaudeville's great days when the tycoons of the business: Keith, Albee, Poli and Loew-booked, literally, thousands of &quot;acts&quot; which performed in hundreds of the nation's theaters. Parading through its pages are acrobats, monologists, male and female impersonators, singers, dancers, kiddy acts and opera stars. Even the major dramatic stars such as Sarah Bernhardt and Ethel Barrymore appeared in one act plays or sketches. The headliners are all here: the Astaires, W.C. Fields, Judy Garland, Milton Berle, Burns &amp; Allen, and Jack Benny, to name only a few. With the hundreds of rare photos from the early 20th Century to the end of the fifties this book is sure to be a &quot;must have&quot; for collectors of Vaudeville memorabilia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c006500d648992dd9ee528cdeb820537b00625ca","amp;dn":"A+Pictorial+History+of+Vaudeville+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c006500d648992dd9ee528cdeb820537b00625ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,6,80,13,100,137,146,221,158,229,40,205,235,130,5,55,176,6,37,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
