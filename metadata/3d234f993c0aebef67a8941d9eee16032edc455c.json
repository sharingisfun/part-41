The Ghosts of the Tanith First-and-Only have been away from the front line for too long. Listless, and hungry for action, they are offered a mission that perfectly suits their talents. The objective: the mysterious SalvationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Reach, a remote and impenetrable stronghold concealing secrets that could change the course of the Sabbat Worlds campaign. But the proposed raid is so hazardous, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s regarded as a suicide mission, and the Ghosts may have been in reserve for so long theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve lost their edge. Haunted by spectres from the past and stalked by the Archenemy, Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and his Ghosts embark upon what could be their finest hourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ or their final mission.\n\n--------------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n--------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d234f993c0aebef67a8941d9eee16032edc455c","amp;dn":"Warhammer+40%2C000++Salvation%5C%27s+Reach+by+Dan+Abnett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d234f993c0aebef67a8941d9eee16032edc455c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,35,79,153,60,10,235,239,103,168,148,29,158,238,22,3,46,220,69,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
