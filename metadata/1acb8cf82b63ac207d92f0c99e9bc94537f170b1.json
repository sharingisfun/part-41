It stars Jeremy Sisto as Jesus, Jacqueline Bisset as Mary of Nazareth, Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene and Gary Oldman as Pontius Pilate.\n\nThe film is notable for presenting a more human Jesus, compared to more solemn portrayals in earlier films; here Jesus laughs and cries much like anyone else. Among other things, he weeps at Joseph's funeral, throws stones in Lake Galilee when meeting Simon Peter and James son of Zebedee for the first time, dances at the wedding at Cana, and starts a water-splashing fight with his disciples at a well. Also, Satan is portrayed as a man in modern dress (and as a woman in red, but the former guise is more prominent). The film adds a Roman historian named &quot;Livio&quot; who watches as events unfold; he is presumably named after Livy.\n\nDVDRip, 1.33 Full Screen, English Audio, xVID codec.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1acb8cf82b63ac207d92f0c99e9bc94537f170b1","amp;dn":"Jesus%3A+The+Movie+%281999%29+%5BDVDRip%2C+1.33+FS%2C+Eng%5D+-+QuincyMKT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1acb8cf82b63ac207d92f0c99e9bc94537f170b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,203,140,248,43,99,172,32,125,146,240,201,158,155,201,69,55,241,112,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
