Following its re-release as a single in 2002, it achieved considerable worldwide success, topping the singles charts in Italy and Belgium (Wallonia), and charting highly in many other countries.\r\nIn addition to features of bhangra music, &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot; also uses the bass line and part of the beat from &quot;Fire It Up&quot; by Busta Rhymes, which in turn is based around a sample from the television theme song for Knight Rider, written by Glen A. Larson and Stu Phillips, as an underlying element and lyrics originally written by Channi Singh. The lyrics of the song are in Punjabi. The video to this song was shot in the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. (wikipedia)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/R7fDrjy.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01. Mundian To Bach Ke (Original Mix)    [3:22]\r\n02.
