When he grows up he spends most of time on his work and ignores his children. One day his father sends him an unusual gift: a penguin. Popper canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but wonder why his father would send him a penguin. He tries to get rid of it, but accidentally orders five more. When his children and ex-wife show up to celebrate his sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birthday, the kids are taken with the penguins. And Popper finally gets to connect with his kids while his work suffers.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396218/\nRelease Date: 17 June 2011 (USA)\nGenre: Comedy\nStars: Jim Carrey, Carla Gugino, Angela Lansbury\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: BluRay.720p.x264.DTS-HDChina\nSize: 600MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b822c861791c421eb0b40fdb8642c1ba76c167c","amp;dn":"Mr.+Popper%26rsquo%3Bs+Penguins+%282011%29+BluRay+720p+600MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b822c861791c421eb0b40fdb8642c1ba76c167c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,130,44,134,23,145,196,33,235,11,64,253,184,100,44,27,167,108,22,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
