Yet throughout much of English history, they were the exception to the rule, while lords and ladies built massive castles of wood to protect their vast holdings.\n\nJourney through the English countryside to see reminders of the countless timber castles that have all but disappeared, leaving behind only the earthen mounds of their foundations. Historians reveal why these wooden fortifications were nearly equal to the much more expensive stone castles, and explain what life was like within their walls. See stunning reconstructions that show what these mighty fortifications looked like and how they were built. And explore fascinating new archaeological evidence that which casts new light on our knowledge and understanding of a time when England was dominated by these long-vanished timber castles.\n\nFile Size ------- 349mb\nLength ---------- 44:08\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 30\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\nThanks to (anonymous) for the generous seedbox donation.\nAlso Supported by \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8c082bb3ef15d77c33bf118278b73c22dffa4b","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+England%5C%27s+Lost+Castles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8c082bb3ef15d77c33bf118278b73c22dffa4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,140,8,43,179,239,21,215,124,51,191,17,130,120,183,60,34,223,250,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
