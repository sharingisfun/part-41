But on the morning of December 26, when the family was relaxing at the pool after Christmas Day, a terrible roar rises from the center of the earth. Mary is paralyzed by fear, while a huge wall of black water runs through the hotel grounds toward her.\n\nHenry is taking her two youngest children, Simon and Thomas, but it's too late: the wave breaks on it with incredible strength and loses control. Maria is pushed underwater, is hit and is battered by water and debris until it is on the verge of death. Finally it surfaces in a raging sea, which has completely submerged three-story hotel and the surrounding landscape. Maria gasps for breath while trying to understand what just happened, convinced that her family has been wiped out in the blink of an eye. But then, his eldest son, Luke (Tom Holland) comes to the surface a few meters below the middle of the wild flood. Face to face with something incomprehensible and unexpected she must fight for the survival of all his son and his own.\n\nProduction notes:\n- Winner of the best film SEVEN SPANISH in the VIII edition of the Cup Film 'The Seventh Art' (2012).\n===================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6052e34baeebcb09b3185e669d01677bf2d08100","amp;dn":"The+Impossible+%282012%29+%5BMicroHD+1080p%5D%5BDUAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6052e34baeebcb09b3185e669d01677bf2d08100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,82,227,75,174,235,203,9,179,24,94,102,157,1,103,123,242,208,129,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
