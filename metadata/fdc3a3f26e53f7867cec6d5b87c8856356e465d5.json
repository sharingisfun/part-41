Even more important, he succeeded in never wavering from coaching his way, from a place of deep values. Jackson was tagged as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zen masterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ half in jest by sportswriters, but the nickname speaks to an important truth: this is a coach who inspired, not goaded; who led by awakening and challenging the better angels of his playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ nature, not their egos, fear, or greed.\n\nThis is the story of a preacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kid from North Dakota who grew up to be one of the most innovative leaders of our time. In his quest to reinvent himself, Jackson explored everything from humanistic psychology and Native American philosophy to Zen meditation. In the process, he developed a new approach to leadership based on freedom, authenticity, and selfless teamwork that turned the hypercompetitive world of professional sports on its head.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdc3a3f26e53f7867cec6d5b87c8856356e465d5","amp;dn":"+Eleven+Rings%3A+The+Soul+of+Success+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdc3a3f26e53f7867cec6d5b87c8856356e465d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,195,163,242,110,83,247,134,124,236,109,91,135,200,133,99,86,228,101,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
