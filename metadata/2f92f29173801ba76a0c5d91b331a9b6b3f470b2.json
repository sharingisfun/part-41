She was awarded the New England Bookseller Award for fiction in 2003. Picoult currently has some 14 million copies of her books in print worldwide.\n\n Picoult's novels tend to centre on human emotion and complex human relationships. Most of her books' storylines incorporate a criminal or civil case which lasts throughout the book's narrative, concluding shortly before the book ends. In books that don't follow this pattern, an attorney character is still often included. At the end of nearly all of her books, there is an unexpected twist.\n\n She became the writer of DC Comics' Wonder Woman (vol. 3) series following the departure of fellow writer Allan Heinberg. Her first issue (#6) was released on March 28, 2007, and her last was issue #10 (released on June 27, 2007).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f92f29173801ba76a0c5d91b331a9b6b3f470b2","amp;dn":"Jodi+Picoult+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f92f29173801ba76a0c5d91b331a9b6b3f470b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,146,242,145,115,128,27,167,106,12,93,145,179,49,169,182,179,244,112,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
