Over the past five years, authors Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher have analyzed hundreds of examples of &quot;bad code&quot; (much of it their own) to determine why theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re bad and how they could be improved. Their conclusion? You need to write code that minimizes the time it would take someone else to understand itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even if that someone else is you.\n\nThis book focuses on basic principles and practical techniques you can apply every time you write code. Using easy-to-digest code examples from different languages, each chapter dives into a different aspect of coding, and demonstrates how you can make your code easy to understand.\n\n    * Simplify naming, commenting, and formatting with tips that apply to every line of code\n    * Refine your programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s loops, logic, and variables to reduce complexity and confusion\n    * Attack problems at the function level, such as reorganizing blocks of code to do one task at a time\n    * Write effective test code that is thorough and conciseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as readable \n\n&quot;Being aware of how the code you create affects those who look at it later is an important part of developing software. The authors did a great job in taking you through the different aspects of this challenge, explaining the details with instructive examples.&quot;\n\n\n# Paperback: 204 pages\n# Publisher: O'Reilly Media; 1 edition (November 23, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0596802293\n# ISBN-13: 978-0596802295","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abf0a9f545b43f5e8b506db8f27911299d767b46","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Readable+Code%2C1st+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abf0a9f545b43f5e8b506db8f27911299d767b46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,240,169,245,69,180,63,94,139,80,109,184,242,121,17,41,157,118,123,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
