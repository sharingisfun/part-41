John tells Dakota he can stay with him as long as he wants, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a catch: For each day he stays, he has to write a journal entry about his life, his problems, and his potential future. With little choice, Dakota agrees, but is wary of the situation, as past experience with strangers has shown to have negative effects. But when things with John begin to work out and life becomes nothing out of the ordinary, his heart finally begins to open and his journey can finally be told.\n\nA story of hope, of healing, and ultimately, of friendship, The Diary of Dakota Hammell offers a brief glimpse into a life of fractured teenager who has lost everything but his ability to write.\n\nCONTAINS MOBI, PDF, ePUB, LRF, and PDB files in a .ZIP FOLDER.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb9a2eb244966148244c7514b54c3f07585f52e5","amp;dn":"The-Diary-of-Dakota-Hammell-by-Kody-Boye2.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb9a2eb244966148244c7514b54c3f07585f52e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,154,46,178,68,150,97,72,36,76,117,20,181,76,63,7,88,95,82,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
