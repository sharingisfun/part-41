Nearly all of the songs on the album remain staples in RatDog's repertoire with good reason, and though the songs have grown immensely over the years, this album remains a treat to hear. Each song is played through without regard to &quot;radio length,&quot; with half of the tunes stretching over 7Ã‚Â½ minutes.\n-ratdog.org\n\nBob Weir - lead vocals, rhythm guitar, slide guitar\nJeff Chimenti - keyboards, background vocals\nMark Karan - lead guitar, background vocals\nJay Lane - drums, background vocals\nRob Wasserman - double bass\n\nKenny Brooks - saxophone on tracks 3 &amp; 7-9\nEric Crystal - saxophone on tracks 3 &amp; 6-9\nDave Ellis - baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone on tracks 3 &amp; 5\nMickey Hart - percussion on tracks 1 &amp; 6-7\nMatthew Kelly - harmonica on tracks 3 &amp; 8-9\nRobbie Kwock - trumpet on tracks 3 &amp; 7-9\nMike McGinn - guitar on tracks 1-2, 6 &amp; 10\nMarty Wehner - trombone on tracks 3 &amp; 7-9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a39b6b7fe23f3c200eaec116c98d2e180606a253","amp;dn":"Ratdog+%282000%29+Evening+Moods+%5BCD-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a39b6b7fe23f3c200eaec116c98d2e180606a253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,155,107,127,226,63,60,32,14,174,193,22,201,141,46,24,6,6,162,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
