This is the pre-turbo version of Journeyman 1.  Just for fun, I played it, and found that it did not run on my Windows 7 pro OS, but did run under the XP emulator that comes with W7pro.  \n\nThere were a few slight display problems (could not clearly read the left information panel), but \nit worked well enough to enjoy and ultimately succeed.  \n\nI suspect that it would run on any version of Windows XP or earlier, and I would not be surprised \nif it ran under DOS as well.\n\nSimply copy all files to a convenient directory, and run JMSETUP.EXE.\n  \nSave often, look everywhere, and pick up everything you can.  Also, read the manual carefully - \nyou will need some of the information along the way, not to mention the three codes that have to be typed in.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b44048efc8f3e1ec5436f38cce3133969bff2a5","amp;dn":"Journeyman+Project+1+pre-turbo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b44048efc8f3e1ec5436f38cce3133969bff2a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,68,4,142,252,143,62,30,197,67,111,56,204,227,19,57,105,191,242,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
