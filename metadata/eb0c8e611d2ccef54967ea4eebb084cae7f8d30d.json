Pepper&amp;#039;s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Digitally remastered by den0iZer)\n\nIn 2007, den0iZer has done this remastering for 40th anniversary of this album and for 20th anniversary of The Beatles&amp;#039; CDs.\nAnd now it&amp;#039;s time to bring you this work to you.\nAgain, this is done for remastering fans, not for Beatles hardcore fans, who like noisy and flat sound of final master. This is den0iZer&amp;#039;s look how could this album sound using today&amp;#039;s sound engineering knowledge and equipment.\n\nSound was restored and remastered using den0iZer&amp;#039;s SRRÃ‚Â® Advanced Restoration technology to achieve the best possible sound without any degradation of original recording. \n\nSo... den0iZer&amp;#039;s works are complete, next albums are already digitally re-mastered by EMI in 1987... :D (are they really digitally remastered? good question)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0c8e611d2ccef54967ea4eebb084cae7f8d30d","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Sgt.+Pepper%5C%27s+Lonely+Hearts+Club+Band+%28Digitall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0c8e611d2ccef54967ea4eebb084cae7f8d30d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,12,142,97,29,44,206,245,73,103,234,78,235,176,132,202,231,248,211,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
