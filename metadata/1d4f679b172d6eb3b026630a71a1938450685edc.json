It's ok. I wouldn't call it 'bad' and it does sound like line audio not cam audio, but it has a light background hiss and repeated clicking noise that gets louder/quieter at different parts. Not so much to spoil it though imho, but just enough I can't imagine anyone wouldn't notice it.&quot;\n\ncredit MajorTJKong for the wise comment above in quotes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d4f679b172d6eb3b026630a71a1938450685edc","amp;dn":"The.Men.Who.Stares.At.Goats.2009.R5.Line.XviD-PrisM+no+rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d4f679b172d6eb3b026630a71a1938450685edc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,79,103,155,23,45,110,179,176,38,99,10,113,161,147,132,80,104,94,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
