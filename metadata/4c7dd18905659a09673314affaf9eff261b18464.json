Some compared it to the Paris Commune, while others called it\nthe first Latin American revolution of the 21st century.\n\n\nBut it was the peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s use of the media\nthat truly made history in Oaxaca.\n\n\nA 90-minute documentary, A Little Bit of So Much Truth captures the unprecedented media phenomenon that emerged when tens of thousands of school teachers, housewives, indigenous communities, health workers, farmers, and students took 14 radio stations and one TV station into their own hands, using them to organize, mobilize, and ultimately defend their grassroots struggle\nfor social, cultural, and economic justice.\n\n\nFilmmaker, Jill Freidberg, had already spent two years in Oaxaca, producing her previous film, Granito de Arena. She returned to Oaxaca, in 2006, and joined forces with Oaxacan media collective, Mal de Ojo TV, to tell the story of the people who put their lives on the line to give a voice to their struggle. Narrated almost entirely with recordings from the occupied media outlets, A Little Bit of So Much Truth delivers a breathtaking, intimate account of the\nrevolution that WAS televised. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.corrugate.org/un_poquito_de_tanta_verdad/synopsis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.corrugate.org/un_poquito_de_tanta_verdad/synopsis&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\nIndymedia Indypeer Noam Chomsky EZLN Zapatista Bourdieu Che Guevara Barack Obama Naomi Klein Globalisation globalization emancipation marxism anarquism human rights\nsocial justice freedom rebellion left attac critique resistance revolution Socialism politics sociology society repression social movement uprising hope change democracy capitalism solidarity history\n\nIndymedia Indypeer Noam Chomsky EZLN Zapatista Bourdieu Che Guevara Barack Obama Naomi\nKlein GlobalizaciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n rebeliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n resistencia revoluciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n\nderechos humanos justicia social libertad rebeliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n marxismo anarquismo critico izquierda\nattac socialismo politica sociologia sociedad represiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n movimiento social insurrecciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n cambio change capitalismo esperanza solidaridad historia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c7dd18905659a09673314affaf9eff261b18464","amp;dn":"Un+Poquito+de+Tanta+Verdad+with+English+subtitles+social+movemen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c7dd18905659a09673314affaf9eff261b18464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,125,209,137,5,101,154,9,103,51,20,175,250,249,239,242,97,177,132,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
