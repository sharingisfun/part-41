For the sake of her family, AngÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lique reluctantly agrees to the match but refuses the advances of her husband, who does not enforce his conjugal rights, wishing only to win her heart. As Angelique gradually discovers virtuous Peyrac's remarkable talents as scientist, musician and philosopher, she falls passionately in love with him. Joffrey's unusual way of life is threatened by the ambitious Archbishop of Toulouse, and soon the jealous young king Louis XIV: Joffrey is arrested for 'sorcery'. AngÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lique single-handedly faces the royal court, surviving murder and poison attempts on herself in a fruitless effort to save Joffrey from the stake. Intent on revenge and survival on her own, AngÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lique desperately joins the dark Paris underworld, finding it now ruled by her youth friend, farmer's son Nicolas, whose true love she had forsaken for her arranged marriage.\n\nCast: \nMichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨le Mercier\t- AngÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lique SancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© de Monteloup\nRobert Hossein\t- Jeoffrey de Peyrac\t\nJean Rochefort\t- Desgrez\nClaude Giraud\t- Philippe de Plessis-Bellieres\nGiuliano Gemma\t- Nicolas\nCharles Regnier\t- Conan Becher\nJacques Toja\t- Louis XIV\nMadeleine Lebeau\t- La Grande Demoiselle\nJean Topart \t- BouriÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\t\nBernard Woringer\t- Benard D'Andijos\nPhilippe Lemaire \t- De Vardes\nJean Ozenne\t- Le marquise de Plessis-Bellieres\nFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Maistre\t- Le prince de CondÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\nRobert Porte\t- Monsieur\nEtchika Choureau\t- Hortense\n\nAudio:\n\tBitrate: 128 kbps\n\tFormat: Mpeg Layer\n\nVideo:\n\tBitrate: 793 kbps\n\tResolution: 656 x 272 pixels\n\tQuadros: 25.000\n\tFormat: Xvid\n\nSize: 744 mb\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ddd957c37e44ca401d2c799b065a7397d83595","amp;dn":"Ang%C3%83%C2%A9lique%2C+Marquise+des+Anges","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ddd957c37e44ca401d2c799b065a7397d83595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,221,217,87,195,126,68,202,64,29,44,121,155,6,90,115,151,216,53,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
