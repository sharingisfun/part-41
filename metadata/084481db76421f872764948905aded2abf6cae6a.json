But when her husband, Brian, leaves her for someone younger, thinner, blonde, and French, she has to step back and take a good, long look at her life.\n\nFirst, her career. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t continue to write about Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happily Ever After,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ so she changes the heroine of her new book from a hot young thing to a forty-something woman who manages to find happiness without a man. Her agent isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too happyÃ¢â‚¬â€the heroine is how old? She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the guy in the end? How is that even possible?\n\nBut Mona is tough, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got Anthony, her personal assistant, and a few good friends to cheer her on and keep the stiff martinis flowing. And Ben. Ben is her plumber, but not your average plumber. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smart enough to know that Brian was never good enough for her, and sexy enough to be cast as the romantic lead in quite a few of her books. The sound of his voice alone can send her imagination into full romantic overdrive.\n\nThen she meets Mitch, who might be just the guy for her. And thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still Ben, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s managed to come to her rescue more than once. ButÃ¢â‚¬â€thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a book to publish, a soon-to-be-ex-husband to deal with, and what has Aunt Lily done this time?\n\nCan Mona work this all out? Can life imitate art, and can Mona write her own happy ending?\n\n--------------\n\ncreate by : Yasser Adnan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084481db76421f872764948905aded2abf6cae6a","amp;dn":"Better+Off+Without+Him+%2C+A+romantic+comedy++%2C+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084481db76421f872764948905aded2abf6cae6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,68,129,219,118,66,31,135,39,100,148,137,5,173,237,42,191,108,174,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
