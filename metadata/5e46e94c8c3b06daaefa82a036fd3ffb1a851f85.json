These can include global goals such as an end to climate change and violent conflict, or national goals such as improved health and literacy, and lower rates of crime and unemployment. Social Policy Bonds would target agreed, explicit outcomes and reward people for achieving them, however they do so. This book is a thorough and entertaining description of how current policymaking is flawed, and how Social Policy Bonds could put it right. The Social Policy Bond idea is proposed by Yale Professor Robert Shiller as one of his ten ways in which finance can do good for society (see http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-shiller/ten-ways-finance-force-for-good_b_1417927.html).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e46e94c8c3b06daaefa82a036fd3ffb1a851f85","amp;dn":"Social+Policy+Bonds%3A+Market+Solutions+for+Social+and+Environment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e46e94c8c3b06daaefa82a036fd3ffb1a851f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,70,233,76,140,59,6,218,174,250,130,160,54,253,63,251,26,133,31,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
