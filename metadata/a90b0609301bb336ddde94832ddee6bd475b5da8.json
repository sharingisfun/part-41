The papers in this volume draw on a wide variety of data sources to describe the contours of this population, from the perspectives of history, demography, geography, education, family, employment, economic well-being, health, and political engagement. They provide a rich source of information for researchers, policy makers, and others who want to better understand the fast-growing and diverse population that we call 'Hispanic'. The current period is a critical one for getting a better understanding of how Hispanics are being shaped by the US experience.This will, in turn, affect the United States and the contours of the Hispanic future remain uncertain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a90b0609301bb336ddde94832ddee6bd475b5da8","amp;dn":"Hispanics+and+the+Future+of+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a90b0609301bb336ddde94832ddee6bd475b5da8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,11,6,9,48,27,179,54,221,222,148,131,45,222,230,189,71,91,93,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
