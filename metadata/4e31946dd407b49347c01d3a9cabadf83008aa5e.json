While this is not the most popular of Hill's excursions, it does reveal a side of the creative pianist rarely heard. What is also intriguing is the inclusion of alternate versions of the tracks &quot;Venture Inward,&quot; &quot;Soul Special,&quot; and &quot;Bayou Red&quot; from the bonus session, which were actually recorded earlier in the year than the master tracks. This makes for some interesting contrasts in interpretation from one session to the next. Finally, only the closing ballad &quot;Love Nocturne&quot; hints at Hill's more enigmatic side for which he is so widely acclaimed.\n\nRecorded at the Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey on April 19 &amp; August 5, 1968. Originally released on Blue Note (84303, 35636). Includes liner notes by Nat Hentoff and Michael Cuscuna.\n\nReissue producer: Michael Cuscuna.\n\nPersonnel: Andrew Hill (piano); Booker Ervin, Frank Mitchell (tenor saxophone); Lee Morgan, Woody Shaw (trumpet); Jimmy Ponder (guitar); Reggie Workman, Ron Carter (bass); Idris Muhammad, Freddie Waits (drums).\n\nAndrew Hill - Grass Roots\nRelease: 1968\nLength: 01:09:02\n\nTracklist:\n01.
