They charged them with 'crimes against humanity' and put them on trial. This Pocket Essential looks at the Nuremberg Trials and at the personalities involved from defendants like Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess to the judges and the prosecuting and defending counsels. It provides a chronology of the proceedings in the court-room and refers frequently to the terrible events Nazi rule had unleashed on Europe for which the defendants found themselves in the dock. The fates of the major players in the drama at Nuremberg are all revealed. And the book asks the questions that were raised at the time and have not been fully answered since. What was the legal validity of the trials and were the ones who were tried always the right people to bear the responsibility for Nazi crimes?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:986220fe7d3d562062de5c088e1a79449b516ad1","amp;dn":"Nazi+War+Trials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"986220fe7d3d562062de5c088e1a79449b516ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,98,32,254,125,61,86,32,98,222,92,8,142,26,121,68,155,81,106,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
