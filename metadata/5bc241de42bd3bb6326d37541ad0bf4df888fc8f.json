However, it was a similarly eclectic and, for the most part, joyous romp through a fusion of bluegrass, rock, folk, and country, with a bit of pop and orchestration along the ride, and the group's superb vocal harmonies being the main constant. &quot;Touch Her If You Can&quot; was the number with the most pop and orchestration, and worked extremely well, with its achingly sad melody. \n\nIf anything the Dillards did on Elektra could have been a hit single, this would have been a likely candidate. Their unusual a cappella arrangement of the Beatles' &quot;Yesterday&quot; caught some attention, and &quot;Brother John&quot; is another simultaneous detour and highlight, with its Dave Brubeck-influenced jazzy rhythms and guitar picking that recalled the Byrds' psychedelic era. While other tracks, like the bluegrass tune &quot;Old Man at the Mill&quot; and Eric Andersen's &quot;Close the Door Lightly,&quot; were more in the standard country-rock mode, they're also good, with the musicians applying care and creative production to the material throughout the disc. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
