In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming\n  8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he\n  takes on hordes of walkers let loose upon the world.\n \n  Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original\n  comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne. Rick must\n  secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from\n  each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the\n  group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the\n  comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison\n  Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting\n  destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.\n \n  Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the\n  award-winning comic's epic story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99a25a0c23a4ee3052e65f80bd7de0d872b6e3fb","amp;dn":"The+Escapists+The+Walking+Dead+Deluxe+Edition+Cracked-3DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99a25a0c23a4ee3052e65f80bd7de0d872b6e3fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,162,90,12,35,164,238,48,82,230,95,128,189,125,224,216,114,182,227,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
