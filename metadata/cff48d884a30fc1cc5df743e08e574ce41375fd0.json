It happened 2 times in 6-7 hours when i was in a base in the &quot;Cluster&quot; tab. BUT it may have to do with my old Radeon 9250 PCI card or that i got this Windows Version: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4577405/XP.Pro.Performance.Edition.December.2008-TJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4577405/XP.Pro.Performance.Edition.December.2008-TJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnyhow. Elseways it works great.
