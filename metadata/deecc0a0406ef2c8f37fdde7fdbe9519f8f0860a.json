This book provides in-depth coverage of the field of biomedical imaging, with particular attention to an engineering viewpoint. Suitable as both a professional reference and as a text for a one-semester course for biomedical engineers or medical technology students, Introduction to Biomedical Imaging covers the fundamentals and applications of four primary medical imaging techniques: magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, and X-ray/computed tomography. Taking an accessible approach that includes any necessary mathematics and transform methods, this book provides rigorous discussions of:* The physical principles, instrumental design, data acquisition strategies, image reconstruction techniques, and clinical applications of each modality* Recent developments such as multi-slice spiral computed tomography, harmonic and sub-harmonic ultrasonic imaging, multi-slice PET scanning, and functional magnetic resonance imaging* General image characteristics such as spatial resolution and signal-to-noise, common to all of the imaging modalities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deecc0a0406ef2c8f37fdde7fdbe9519f8f0860a","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Biomedical+Imaging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deecc0a0406ef2c8f37fdde7fdbe9519f8f0860a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,236,192,160,64,110,242,200,243,127,221,231,253,190,149,25,248,240,134,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
