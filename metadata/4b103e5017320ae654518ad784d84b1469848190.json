I didn't use 2 indexes\nfor each install on this one because the previous version with\nOEM branding severely hampered the boot-setup. Vista likes to\nread all of the OOBE info during that phase. You can still use\nthe previous version if you like it better.\n\nI played around with different methods of integration for over\na week. Seriously. I did all sorts of audit-mode - sysprep\ncaptures from pre-integrated sources and original sources.\nThe end result just wasn't satisfactory and I've accomplished\nthe same thing with Vlite using about 1.5gigs less space,\nminus directx web runtimes. Chances are if someone really\nwants to use Vista, they aren't doing it for 3D games anyway.\n\nSo that's it folks, this is the last Vista I'll do and it's\nas un-crappy as I can make it. If it isn't satisfactory to\nyou, you can just not use it.  If you want to add the OEM\nbranding from the mdl project, just copy the oem folder stuff\ninto the oem folder from my release, but note that it will\nseriously slow down the initial install. I tested the hell\nout of every single one of these indexes. If you have a\nproblem, it's probably on your end.\n\nCondolances Pirates,\nmurphy78-TPB :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b103e5017320ae654518ad784d84b1469848190","amp;dn":"Windows+Vista+SP2+AIO+x64+x86+en-US+DaRT8+FINAL+Feb2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b103e5017320ae654518ad784d84b1469848190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,16,62,80,23,50,10,230,84,81,138,215,132,216,75,20,105,132,129,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
