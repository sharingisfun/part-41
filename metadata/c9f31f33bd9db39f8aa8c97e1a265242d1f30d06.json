The decision to\n                hold equestrian events in Greenwich Park is one of\n                the most controversial choices made by the\n                authorities. Among the many groups against it are\n                local residents, led by film director Tony Ward.\n                Given that it's over thirty years since he made his\n                one and only successful film, Ward has had a lot of\n                time on his hands to plan his campaign of protest. It\n                starts with the arrival of a pile of horse manure on\n                the pavement outside the Deliverance Commission\n                offices and climaxes with a live head-to-head debate\n                with Head of Deliverance Ian Fletcher on Radio 4's\n                Today programme. All is not well in Ian's personal\n                life either, but his ever-loyal PA Sally is on hand\n                and ready to pick up the pieces.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f31f33bd9db39f8aa8c97e1a265242d1f30d06","amp;dn":"Twenty.Twelve.S01E06.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f31f33bd9db39f8aa8c97e1a265242d1f30d06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,243,31,51,189,157,179,159,138,168,201,126,26,38,82,66,209,243,13,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
