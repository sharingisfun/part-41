As such, I'm releasing this torrent (thanks Muzaffar) since it is a worthy sequel to his mostly-jumpstyle album, Kick's for Liberation. This album focuses more on hardstyle, and is a solid album, and sadly there isn't too much variation (which can be a very risky thing). As a result there are no *bad* tracks on the whole disc, but a few stale ones. Despite that criticism, it's still a good album. Half the album consists of arranges of his first album by other J-Core artists, and they're pretty well done. If you like USAO, you're already going to get it, and if you're searching for some new hardstyle, Kick's for Liberation 2 deserves at least a juicy sample.\n\nMy top picks are &quot;Another Sect (USAO &amp; DJ Nanashi Mix)&quot; [man this track sounds like some from the demoscene] and &quot;Sakura Era (DJ Nanashi Remix)&quot;.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n01. Intro\n02. Escape\n03. Freezing Dark\n04. Realizing Time\n05. Dream Space\n06. Another Sect(USAO &amp; DJ Nanashi mix)\n07. Sakura Era (Shingo DJ Remix)\n08. Directionality (Noizenecio Remix)\n09.
