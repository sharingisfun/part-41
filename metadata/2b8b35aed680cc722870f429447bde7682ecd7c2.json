What started in Sex Bomb (their debut album), as retro kitsch wah had degenerated further into raw riffs, panting and openly suggestive.\n\nThe influence of The Rolling Stones is not in any way disguised in this release. At the time they were recording this Nick and Jeff Pitcher were DJing at The Basement nightclub in Brighton.  They were playing 60s and 70s garage rock; bands like the MC5, The Stooges and The Ramones.  Which would be a huge influence on them.  I Am The Greatest features a sample for an Iggy Pop live album, this sample is uncredited in the sleeve notes.  There is a hidden track on here which is amusingly tucked away at track number 69\n\nThe Spitfire Ã¢â‚¬ËœSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ World of Sport logo t-shirts became a fashion item.  Members of  Britpop bands Elastica, Menswe@r, Lush and Supergrass were seen wearing them.\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\nJudy Garland\nHey Go Easy\nRubber Rosie\nElectric Colour Climax\nRip My Sweetheart\nGemini Born Angel\nTurbo Starbars\nGimme Ya Good Times\nI am the Greatest\nGive Blood\nBaredoll\nShit City\nDead End\n69 CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢mon Get On (Hidden Bonus Track)\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease help me seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8b35aed680cc722870f429447bde7682ecd7c2","amp;dn":"Spitfire+-+Electric+Colour+Climax+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b8b35aed680cc722870f429447bde7682ecd7c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,139,53,174,214,128,204,114,40,112,244,41,68,123,222,118,130,236,215,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
