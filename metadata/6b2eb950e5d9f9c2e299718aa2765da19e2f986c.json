The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.\n\n\nFeatures\nCan be run as a standalone application\nWorks well with all system languages\nCustom OEM information can be installed\nArgument support for silent installs\nCan be used for pre-activation\nApplication integrity checking\nCustom error handling\nSupport for hidden partitions and complex setups\nCan work alongside Linux's GRUB or any other boot manager\nWorks with TrueCrypt and many other types of hard drive encryption applications\nAdd your own certificates and serials externally\nOffers certificate and serial installation only for users with an existing SLIC 2.1\nAutomated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)\n\nThe rundown\n\nCompatible with Windows 7 SP1 and all system updates ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\nWill run on x86 and x64 systems ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\nNo core system files get modified ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\nNo extra processes are run so you have nothing eating at your RAM ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\nAll key parts of the exploit are encrypted with a custom encryption ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\nThe exploit runs before Windows so it's harder for Microsoft to prevent ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\nThe exploit patches all necessary tables making activation look authentic ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\nThe application will select the best profile for your system during installation ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\nEach and every user has a unique version of the exploit installed on his/her system ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n\nSupported operating systems\nWindows 7 Ultimate\nWindows 7 Ultimate E\nWindows 7 Professional\nWindows 7 Professional E\nWindows 7 Home Premium\nWindows 7 Home Premium E\nWindows 7 Home Basic\nWindows 7 Starter\nWindows 7 Starter E\nWindows Vista Ultimate\nWindows Vista Business\nWindows Vista Business N\nWindows Vista Home Premium\nWindows Vista Home Basic\nWindows Vista Home Basic N\nWindows Vista Starter\nWindows Server 2008 R2: Enterprise\nWindows Server 2008 R2: Standard\nWindows Server 2008 R2: Foundation\nWindows Server 2008: Enterprise\nWindows Server 2008: Standard\nWindows Server 2008: Foundation\nWindows Small Business Server 2008\nNote: You must be running build 7600 or greater for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\nNote: I don't recommend using any of the Windows 7 E editions.\nNote: Windows 7 N editions will only be supported when OEM SLP serials leak.\n\n\nApplication integrity checking?\n\nHover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.\n\nNote: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\n\nVirus scanner results\n\nAll virus scanner detection's are a false-positive.
