A great read if you are a fan of the classics, and even if you are a modern Avengers reader only, you are sure to enjoy this lighthearted look at years gone by with tonge planted firmly in cheek. This copy is the digital version by Minutemen-InnerDemons; thanks to them for their hard work, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76b3350cab34b61c64d69cd8eace6b3f16129109","amp;dn":"Avengers+001.5+%281999%29+%28Digital%29+%28Minutemen-InnerDemons%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76b3350cab34b61c64d69cd8eace6b3f16129109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,179,53,12,171,52,182,28,100,214,156,216,234,206,107,63,22,18,145,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
