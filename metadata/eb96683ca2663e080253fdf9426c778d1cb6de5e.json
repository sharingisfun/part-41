Previously, the band had released three singles that laid the groundwork for the dense, throbbing Lust and its club hits, &quot;Rough Sex&quot; and &quot;I Must Increase My Bust.&quot; Between their debut and their second album, 1994's Voodoo-U, Lords of Acid added industrial elements to their sound and became a more straightforward, band-oriented group. At the time of their second album, Lords of Acid were led by Lady Galore (born Ruth McArdle; vocals) and featured bassist Lord T. Byron (born Frank Vloeberghs), keyboard player Shai de la Luna, and drummer McGuinness (born Kurt Liekens). Subsequent efforts include 1997's Our Little Secret and 1999's Expand Your Head. Farstucker followed in early 2001, as well as a series of &quot;stript&quot; (their term) re-releases that cut the vocals from the original albums. With a few unreleased cuts, the 2005 compilation Greatest T*ts would have to hold fans over until 2011 when the Little Mighty Rabbit EP arrived. The EP's title track would be featured on the album Deep Chills, which followed in 2012. \n\nOriginally a fan club-only release with a limited edition of 500 copies, the Lords of Acid's Heaven Is an Orgasm features rare and previously unreleased songs, including &quot;Superstar,&quot; &quot;Acid Queen,&quot; &quot;Robot Love,&quot; &quot;Orchestral Sinsations,&quot; and &quot;The Mirror.&quot; Another dose of libidinous, humorous techno from a group that specializes in it. \n\n\nGenre................: Electronic\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Superstar\n02.Praise The Lords\n03.Stay Awake\n04.The Dude\n05.Feel So Alive\n06.Orchestral Sinsations\n07.Acid Queen\n08.The Mirror\n09.Robot Love\n10.Don't Kill For Love\n11.Undress And Possess\n12.She And Mr. Jones (Uncensored Version)\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb96683ca2663e080253fdf9426c778d1cb6de5e","amp;dn":"Lords+Of+Acid+-Heaven+Is+An+Orgasm+%281998%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb96683ca2663e080253fdf9426c778d1cb6de5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,150,104,60,162,102,62,8,2,83,253,249,66,108,119,141,28,182,222,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
