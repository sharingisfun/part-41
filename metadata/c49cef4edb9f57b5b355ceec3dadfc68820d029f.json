For misdirection is the heart of all magic-and perfect crimes.\n\nCrime School (book 6)\nPolice Detective Kathleen Mallory recognized the dead call girl. It was someone from her past, a woman who protected her on the streets of New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â€and who betrayed her. Mallory also recognized the crime scene: victim hanging, hair in mouth, fire burning. It happened twenty-one years ago, when Mallory was a child. NowÃ¢â‚¬â€whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the work of a copy-cat killer or a serial murdererÃ¢â‚¬â€it has happened again.\n\nKathleen MalloryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past has finally caught up with her.\n\nWinter House (book 8 )\nA reclusive senior citizen kills an intruderÃ¢â‚¬â€but there's more to the story. In Carol O'Connell's new novel New York City officer Kathleen Mallory purges a woman of her mysterious pastÃ¢â‚¬â€and the flesh-and-blood ghosts of a violent family legacy.\n\nFind Me (book 9)\nOn Route 66, as word travels that children's grave sites are being discovered along the road, the parents of missing children form a silent caravan.
