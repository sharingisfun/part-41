Compiled and issued by the label with no input from Dylan himself, it contains no original Dylan songs, the material consisting of two outtakes from Self Portrait and another seven from New Morning. It followed the artist's departure from Columbia for Asylum Records, and the announcement of his first major tour since 1966.\n\nAlthough Dylan received very poor reviews, it managed to hit #17 in the US and become a gold record. It is the only Columbia Dylan album not to be reissued on compact disc in the North American market at the request of Dylan himself. Recently the album has been re-issued on digital disc included in the The Complete Album Collection Vol. One box set (2013). It became his first album never to chart in the UK, where his albums generally charted higher than in the US. In Europe, it was called Dylan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A Fool Such as I. A different recording of &quot;Spanish Is the Loving Tongue&quot; had been issued as the B-side of Dylan's 1971 single &quot;Watching the River Flow&quot;. Until December 2009, the album was available on iTunes as part of the download Bob Dylan: The Collection. The first seven tracks were recorded in June 1970 for New Morning sessions; the last two recorded in April 1969 for Self Portrait sessions. \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Lily of the West&quot;   \ttraditional \t3:44\n02. \t&quot;Can't Help Falling in Love&quot;   Weiss,Peretti\t4:17\n03. \t&quot;Sarah Jane&quot;   \ttraditional \t2:43\n04. \t&quot;The Ballad of Ira Hayes&quot;   \tPeter LaFarge \t5:08\n05. \t&quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;   \tJerry Jeff Walker \t5:31\n06. \t&quot;Mary Ann&quot;   \ttraditional \t2:40\n07. \t&quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;   \tJoni Mitchell \t2:12\n08. \t&quot;A Fool Such as I&quot;   \tBill Trader \t2:41\n09. \t&quot;Spanish Is the Loving Tongue&quot;   \t4:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:094b3e99b552575eef455f40c02c18cdef3ef84e","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Dylan+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"094b3e99b552575eef455f40c02c18cdef3ef84e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,75,62,153,181,82,87,94,239,69,95,64,192,44,24,205,239,62,248,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
