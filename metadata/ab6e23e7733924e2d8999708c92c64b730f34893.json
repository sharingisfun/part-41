Overall, I was very pleased with the way that these episodes all look in DVD. The series never really went over the top with the colors, instead opting to leave the locals used in the show looking as they would being in the big city and all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ rather drab. This DVD collection reproduces that look quite faithfully and it does so with style. There's a nice level of detail present throughout and print damage is limited to just the odd speck and scratch here and there. Edge enhancement is minor, and there are no problems with mpeg compression that I was able to notice. Black levels stay reasonably strong and deep, and flesh tones look lifelike and natural.\nSound:\n\nWhile the Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono English language soundtrack is reasonably clear without any hiss or distortion, the levels are just a hair low on this set. That's easily corrected by simply turning up the volume to accommodate this though, and once that's done there aren't any problems. Obviously with an older mono TV show you're not going to get a lot of effects or any channel separation but the dialogue is easy enough to follow and it's never overshadowed by the sound effects or background music at all. It's a 'no frills' mix but it takes care of business.\n\n\nFormer releases from me on TPB:\n\nKojak - Season 1 Box (2-disc) \nManhunter (RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶da Draken) DVD-9 \nThe Two Jakes (DVD-9)\nOrfeu Negro (DVD-9)\nLife On Mars - Season 2 (4 disc DVD-9)\nLife On Mars - Season 1 (2 disc DVD-9)\nCrimson Rivers 2: Angels of the Apocalypse (DVD-9)\nCapricorn One DVD-9\nHUNDDAGAR (Hundstage) (DVD-5)\nKebab Connection (DVD-9)\nThe Wages of Fear - Fruktans LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶n (PAL DVD-9)\nThe Vampire's Night Orgy (NTSC DVD-5) \nThe Pixies Sell Out - 2004 Reunion Tour (NTSC DVD-9)\nWelle: Erdball DVD-5 + CD \nRamones: End of the Century (NTSC DVD-9) \nBeCool PAL DVD-5 \nMy Big Fat Greek Life DVD-5 \nVarannan vecka DVD-9 \nStockholm Boogie DVD-5 \nTjenare Kungen DVD-5 \nLed Zeppelin PAL - DVD 1 of 2 \nDVD-9 Led Zeppelin PAL - DVD 2 of 2 DVD-9 \nVideodrome - PAL DVD - DVD-5 \nThe Black Sabbath Story - Vol 1: 1970-1978 PAL DVD \nCinema Paradiso [DIRECTOR'S CUT] PAL DVD \nR E M - In View: The Best of R E M 1988-2003 - PAL DVD \nThe POLICE-Every Breath You Take - PAL DVD + Cover \nThe Cure - Trilogy - PAL DVD 2 of 2\nThe Cure - Trilogy - PAL DVD 1 of 2 \nBill Wyman s (The Rolling Stones) Blues Odyssey - PAL DVD + COVER \nPunk Generation - PAL DVD \nThe Clash - Rude Boy: Special Edition PAL DVD \nMad Max 1 - PAL DVD - SWESUB \nBruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band: Live In Barcelona 2 of 2 - PAL DVD \nBruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band: Live In Barcelona 1 of 2 - PAL DVD \nThe Who - The Kids Are Alright Disc 2 (Special Edition) 1979 NTSC DVD \nThe Who - The Kids Are Alright Disc 1 (Special Edition) 1979 NTSC DVD \nThe Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story - PAL - DVD \nZiggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars - The Motion Picture - PAL DVD \nSimon &amp; Garfunkel - The Concert in Central Park 1981 - PAL DVD \nGimme Some Truth - John Lennons Imagine Documentary PAL DVD \nPopulÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rmusik FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n Vittula 2004 SWEDISH - SUOMALAINEN FULL DVD-9 \nThe Blue Light - Ao no hono-o - PAL DVD DIVA - PAL DVD \nTommy The Movie - 1975 - PAL DVD \nDeep Purple - Heavy Metal Pioneers - NTSC DVD \nThe Beatles - The First U.S Visit - PAL DVD \nWoodstock - PAL DVD \nRolling Stones Live at the Max - PAL DVD \nBob Dylan MTV UNPLUGGED - PAL DVD \nThe Ring - PAL DVD SCANDINAVIAN SUB \nRing 0 Birthday - PAL DVD NORDIC SUB \nRing 2 - PAL DVD NORDIC SUB \nBreaking Point.1975 - Svensktextad \nBullet proof Monk - PAL DVD NORDIC SUBS \nAntikiller - PAL DVD NORDIC SUBS DVD-5\nA Man Called Hero - Zhong hua ying xiong PAL DVD DVD-5\nThe Filth and the Fury &quot;Sex Pistols Documentary&quot; PAL DVD DVD-5 \nThe Twilight Samurai - Tasogare Seibei DVD-9\nDawn of the Dead 2004 NORDIC SUB PAL DVD-5 \nRed Lion - Akage DVD-5\nBichunmoo - Flying Warriors DVD-5 \nCradle 2 the Grave DVD-5\nShogun Assassin DVD-5 \n2046 DVD-5\nTai Chi Master DVD-5\nHair 1979 DVD-5 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6e23e7733924e2d8999708c92c64b730f34893","amp;dn":"Kojak+S1+E9-16+DVD-9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6e23e7733924e2d8999708c92c64b730f34893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,110,35,231,115,57,36,226,216,153,151,8,201,44,100,183,48,243,72,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
