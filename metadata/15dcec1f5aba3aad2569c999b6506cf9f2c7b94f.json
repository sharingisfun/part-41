This improves usage speed a LOT and this way your orginal CD doesn't get worned out \n  -You can keep important CDs handy as image files for exp. in your laptop. \n   \n  Daemon Tools is able to emulate most copy protections, so they won't keep you from taking the advantage of virtual drives. \n   \n  I have worked with this tool a little and I must say that I am quite impressed. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges from Daemon Tools v3.46 to Daemon Tools v3.47 \nFixed lockup with some images containing bad sectors made by Alcohol (MDS) \n\nFixed Nero InCD formatting problem with DAEMON Tools present \nFixed atapi.sys locking problem (as a result, some emulation ability is removed for PCD5 until new release) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15dcec1f5aba3aad2569c999b6506cf9f2c7b94f","amp;dn":"Daemon+tools+New+Version++3.47","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15dcec1f5aba3aad2569c999b6506cf9f2c7b94f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,220,236,31,90,186,58,173,37,105,201,153,182,80,108,249,242,199,185,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
