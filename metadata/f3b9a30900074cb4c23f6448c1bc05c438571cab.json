As we               \n         mentioned yesterday, at the time of his death Disney        \n         was set to buy the Henson company outright, and in          \n         preparation of this a long line of co-productions           \n         were happening, including the Here Come The Muppets         \n         and Muppets on Location: Days of Swine and Roses            \n         stage shows, various walk-arounds, and the still            \n         running ever popular Muppet*Vision 3D - the last            \n         thing Jim ever directed - which didn't premiere             \n         until 1991.                                                 \n                                                                     \n           The Muppets at Walt Disney World was intended to          \n         spread awareness about the merger, by having The            \n         Muppets crash WDW, after revealing that Kermit's            \n         hometown of Paradise Swamp, Florida is just on the          \n         other side of the park. This ends up being an               \n         effective cross-promotion of The Muppets and the            \n         park as well as Disney properties in general -              \n         just as they had intended.                                  \n                                       Enjoy!                        \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                               \n                                                                     \n                              ~HO HO HO~                             \n                                                                    \n                                                              \n                 For the month of December we've decided to     \n                do something special.
