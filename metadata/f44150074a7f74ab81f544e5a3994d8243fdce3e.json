Mariella then meets Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, who shares his passion for Ferrari GTos. &quot;There are so few of them, there is usually only one for sale at any given time,&quot; he says, reflecting on his car's racing history and its personal value, having used it as a wedding car for both of his daughters. Psychologists discuss why, once our basic needs are met, we strive for excess material goods, filling our lives with things we don't need, but really want. But as this series reveals, seldom few can afford such luxuries.\n\n2)  Living our Dreams \nMariella explores the lure of Savile Row, the longevity of the little black dress and the global desire for diamonds as she takes a sweeping look at iconic styles and indulgent fashion and beauty items. Including Holly Golightly's little black Givenchy dress in Breakfast at Tiffany's (which sold at auction for nearly half a million pounds), the De Beers' clever 'Diamonds are Forever' advertising campaign, which helped to turn a relatively common stone into one of the most sought-after commodities in the world, and the enduring appeal of similar tokens of design and affluence.\n\n3)  Its all about Us \nMariella delves into the appeal of anthropomorphic designs, exploring the aesthetic power, personality and inspiration behind the Mini, the VW Beetle, the E-Type Jaguar and the Coca-Cola bottle. How do people form emotional bonds with cars, even to go as far as giving them names? Mariella looks back at some of the most famous celeb cars, brilliant advertising campaigns, and a designer who turned a car into a huge chandelier. Elsewhere, Mariella looks at how practical everyday objects are turned into witty and playful works of art, and how the 'Mae West' Coca-Cola bottle came to symbolize the American dream and simple happiness.\n\n4)  For the love of the Craft \nMariella tours the Hermes scarves factory, meets luxury leather accessories creator Bill Amberg, and speaks to 'Holy Man of Heels' Manolo Blanik, as she discovers the secret behind some of the most luxurious hand-crafted items in the world. She investigates why a silk scarf is sold every 25 seconds and reveals the intensive and time-consuming process behind each and every one, before meeting the shoe designer whose flamboyant creations are coveted by Sarah Jessica Parker and housed in the V&amp;A Museum. Mariella also explores the opulent country home of Jasper Conran who talks about his latest collection for Wedgwood, before she tries her own hand at pottery.\n\n5)  Innovation \nMariella examines the coveted creations of innovators including Apple design guru Jonathan Ive and designers Thomas Heatherwick and Kenneth Grange. In a rare interview with Jonathan Ive, she gets to the bottom of the incredible loyalty people have towards Apple and its sleek products and the reason so many are prepared to queue outside the company's stores on the day of a new product launch. She also visits the workshops of Seed Cathedral designer Thomas Heatherwick where she tries out a seat that behaves like a spinning top, and meets Kenneth Grange, a British man credited with the design of the angle poise lamp, black cabs, Parker pens and Kodak cameras. Later, she explores the innovative designs created for London 2012.\n\n6)  The Charity Auction \nIt's time to put some of the most coveted items in the world under the hammer as Mariella presents the Sky Arts HD Objects of Desire Auction. Donated by their designers, some of the top items seen in the series go under the hammer of charasmatic auctioneer Simon de Pury, known as the Mick Jagger of the podium. Buyers engage in financial fisticuffs over fantastic works from artists, designers, and stars who are sometimes rendered speechless by the amount their pieces raise for their chosen charity. Will your favourite item from the series be there?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/6987/zo6o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/6987/zo6o.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/9615/3vec.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/9615/3vec.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/2453/odc3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/2453/odc3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/7038/f0l7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/7038/f0l7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/7425/i18i.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/7425/i18i.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/9366/83e9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/9366/83e9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/2048/9fgw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/2048/9fgw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/2084/xj48.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/2084/xj48.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3740/3eq6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3740/3eq6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/2520/rq3f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/2520/rq3f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/3615/fsyu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/3615/fsyu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4228/0xfh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4228/0xfh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4800212f2008047b6678&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 2139 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 44mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 665 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://skyarts.sky.com/tags/mariella-frostrup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://skyarts.sky.com/tags/mariella-frostrup&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f44150074a7f74ab81f544e5a3994d8243fdce3e","amp;dn":"BSkyB+Object+of+Desire+3of6+Its+all+about+Us+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f44150074a7f74ab81f544e5a3994d8243fdce3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,65,80,7,74,127,116,171,129,245,68,229,163,153,77,130,67,253,206,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
