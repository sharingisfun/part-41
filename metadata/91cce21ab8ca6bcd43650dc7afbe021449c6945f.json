This version gave me the opportunity to explore tracks of extended length and complexity. Because the N64 allowed me to use all the available samples I was able to achieve many combinations of textures for each level. The result is distinctive but still feels connected to the overall style of the first two soundtracks I composed for the series.&quot;\n\nReleased 12 January 2013.\n\nIf you like the music, support the artist, buy it!\naubreyhodges bandcamp com album doom-64-official-soundtrack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cce21ab8ca6bcd43650dc7afbe021449c6945f","amp;dn":"Doom+64+OST+by+Aubrey+Hodges+%282013%29+%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cce21ab8ca6bcd43650dc7afbe021449c6945f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,204,226,26,184,202,107,205,67,101,13,199,175,190,2,20,73,198,148,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
