Alex also analyzes how the shooting weaves perfectly into the government's rightwing extremist meme, which essentially equates conservatives with Al Qaeda, and looks at the various developments in the ongoing push for amnesty. \n\nOn today's show, Alex welcomes Andrew Demeter, the young activist and documentary film maker who recently confronted House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on the NSA's &quot;illegal and ubiquitous data collection.&quot; \n\nWe'll also examine how Hillary Clinton's book has begun mobilizing a campaign of sexism in anticipation of a 2016 presidential run.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
