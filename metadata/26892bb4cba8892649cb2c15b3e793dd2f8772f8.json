IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard three versions of this song, and I dig them all. One is by Tony Allen and The Champs from the 50s, another is by Bobby Paris, which was a Northern Soul hit in the 60Ã¢â‚¬Â²s, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great reggae version by Horace Andy from the early 70s. Our rhythm is like the Bobby Paris version, and our chorus is more like Tony AllenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. If I ever met Horace, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ask him what version he was influenced by. I feel this is the kinda song where everyone adds something to every new version as it floats down the river of music. Our addition to the Ã¢â‚¬ËœNight OwlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was our call and response Outro.\n \n \n \nTim Timebomb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar, Lead Vocals\nDave McKean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums, Background vocal\nDoug McKean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass, Guitar\nAustin Ã¢â‚¬Å“walkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ caneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Charnanghat -Guitar\nJustin Gorski -Keys\nRyan Foltz -Background Vocal, Percussion\nLiz Kelly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Background Vocal\nKevin Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Percussion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26892bb4cba8892649cb2c15b3e793dd2f8772f8","amp;dn":"Night+Owl+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26892bb4cba8892649cb2c15b3e793dd2f8772f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,137,43,180,203,168,137,38,73,203,44,21,179,231,147,221,47,135,114,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
