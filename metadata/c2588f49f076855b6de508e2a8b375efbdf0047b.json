(I couldn't get it to mount. Though to be honest  I didnt try very hard, so u may be able to)\n\nTo do this..\nCreate a Dethkarz folder. open the DethKarz.rar file  and drag the .bin and .cue files over into the new folder.\n\n(for those who dont know, a .rar file is very similar to .zip file you may need to install winrar)\n\n\n Now in your Dethkarz folder click dethkarz.cue. Your Cd burning software should now pop up and take over the procedure. I used Nero 8.\n\n This is the complete game and works 99.9% fine.  You will need to configure the graphics.  However,the opening movie sequence doesnt show properly (at least with my graphics card anyhow.. ) but the actual game looks and runs great especially considering this is quite an old game.\n\n\nStill a very enjoyable game. The graphics look good even after all these years.!\n\n                         Enjoy!\n\n                                 Bzerka\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2588f49f076855b6de508e2a8b375efbdf0047b","amp;dn":"DethKarz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2588f49f076855b6de508e2a8b375efbdf0047b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,88,143,73,240,118,133,91,109,229,8,226,168,179,117,239,189,240,4,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
