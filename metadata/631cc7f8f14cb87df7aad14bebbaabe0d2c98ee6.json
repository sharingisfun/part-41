Who were they and where did they go? A centerpiece in the study of human evolution, Neanderthal Man has, by his own mysterious demise, created more questions than he has answered\n\nBut what if Neanderthals could answer for themselves and tell us about their origins?\nNow, for the first time, that is possible through the original research of Jack Cuozzo. Fascinated by Neanderthal Man for over two decades, Cuozzo, an orthodontist, has fashioned a research book that will clutch the attention of scientists and laypersons alike, for the Neanderthal family has finally emerged to tell a shocking story.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Jack Cuozzo has been an orthodontist in New Jersey for 33 years. He prepared for his career through studies at Georgetown University (biology major, philosophy minor) and degrees from the University of Pennsylvania (DDS) and Loyola University / Chicago Graduate School of Dentistry (MS, Oral Biology; Certificate of Specialty in Orthodontics).
