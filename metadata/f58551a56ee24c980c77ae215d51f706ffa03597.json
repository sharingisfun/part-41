The game revolves around HAZMAT operative Ethan Cole, who has been summoned to Area 51 to discover the source of a deadly virile outbreak. He soon discovers that the staff of the secret alien research base has mutated into deadly, dangerous enemies. Even worse, Ethan himself quickly becomes infected. While the game is a fairly straight-forward first person shooter involving blasting everything that moves while searching for keys, secret codes, and other clues, it does have some interesting twists. Once Ethan becomes infected with the virus, he gains the ability to mutate into a stronger form complete with two ranged attacks. The visuals also change, taking on an almost infra-red interface. Once the single-player missions are finished, AREA 51 offers gamers a multiplayer mode that accommodates up to 16 players. Several different options are available, including deathmatch, capture the flag, and infection, in which players can play as mutants and attempt to infect the human players. There are also unlockable secrets that can be found by scanning objects, , computer workstations, and corpses. While AREA 51 has been absent from the arcade for awhile, first person shooter fans will immediately latch on to its Pc Games version. Fans of THE X-FILES should also check it out to hear star David Duchovny voice Ethan Cole.\n\n*Extensive Single-Player Campaign Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Battle through corridors of Area 51 and attempt to discover the secrets of an extraterrestrial menace before it is too late.\n\n*Story-Driven Epic Adventure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Engage in an epic adventure through eight massive sections of a secretive complex.\n\n*Fearsome Weaponry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Equip yourself with more than 15 types of human and alien weapons and other equipment as you explore dark corridors of the secret base.\n\n*Alien Menace Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Battle fierce, horrific creatures designed by Stan Winston Studios, famed creature designer for such films as Ã¢â‚¬Å“AliensÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jurassic ParkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“PredatorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n*Government Conspiracies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Explore and discover a multitude of secret items and areas, including the real answers behind such conspiracy theories.\n\n*Online Combat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Battle online where you can easily access the many systems allowing you to find your friends and set up your own matches.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 6, 2005\nM for Mature: Realistic Violence\nGenre: First-Person Shooter\nPublisher: Midway Games\nDeveloper: Midway Studios -- Austin\n\nMinimum Requirements\n1.4GHz P4 or equivalent\n256MB RAM\n64MB 3D card\n3.0GB hard drive space\nSupported Functions\nNumber Of Players: 1-2\nOnline\n\nInstallation:\n1.Burn or Mount\n2.Install\n3.Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58551a56ee24c980c77ae215d51f706ffa03597","amp;dn":"Area-51+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58551a56ee24c980c77ae215d51f706ffa03597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,133,81,165,110,226,76,152,12,119,174,33,93,81,247,6,255,160,53,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
