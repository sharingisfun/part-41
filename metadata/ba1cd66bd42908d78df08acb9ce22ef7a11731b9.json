They compose a \n\nnew kind of world music, \n\nsometimes called ethnic \n\nelectronica, mixing ethnic with \n\nelectronic sounds and dance beats \n\nor chillout beats. Their sound has \n\nbeen described as an \n\n&quot;ethno-introspective ambient \n\nworld music&quot;. They were \n\nnominated for a Grammy Award \n\nin 1993 for Best World Music \n\nAlbum, and in 1996 they won the \n\nAward for the album Boheme. \n\nThe group also became World \n\nMusic Awards Winner - French \n\ngroup with the highest 1995 world \n\nsales. Their albums have sold over \n\n10 million copies.\n\nBoheme is the Grammy Award \n\nWinning (for Best World Music \n\nAlbum) second album of the \n\nFrench duo Deep Forest, released \n\nin 35 countries. It mainly sampled \n\nEastern European gypsy songs \n\n(e.g. the Bohemians, hence the \n\nname of the album) with \n\nelectronic music. Hit singles \n\nincluded &quot;Marta's Song&quot; \n\n(featuring MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rta SebestyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n) and \n\n&quot;Freedom Cry&quot;. The album \n\nbecame the duo's most successful \n\none, selling over 4 million copies \n\nand receiving a number of \n\nDiamond, Platinum and Gold \n\nawards in 15 countries.\n\nThe song &quot;Freedom Cry&quot; has later \n\ncaused controversy when it was \n\nrevealed that the singer, KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡roly \n\n&quot;HuttyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n&quot; RostÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, never received \n\nany monetary compensation from \n\nthe song, and neither did his \n\nfamily after he died in 1986. His \n\nsinging was archived by Claude \n\nFlagel, which was later sampled \n\nby Deep Forest. Flagel allegedly \n\npaid HuttyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n 1500 forints for the \n\nrecording. The case was later \n\ndocumented in a movie entitled \n\nHuttyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n, released in 1996.\n\n&quot;Anasthasia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:48\n&quot;Bohemian Ballet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n&quot;Marta's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n&quot;Gathering&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n&quot;Lament&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n&quot;Bulgarian Melody&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n&quot;Deep Folk Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:13\n&quot;Freedom Cry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n&quot;Twosome&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n&quot;Cafe Europa&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n&quot;Katharina&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n&quot;Boheme&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba1cd66bd42908d78df08acb9ce22ef7a11731b9","amp;dn":"Deep+Forest...Boheme%281995%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba1cd66bd42908d78df08acb9ce22ef7a11731b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,28,214,107,212,41,8,215,141,240,138,203,156,226,46,247,161,23,49,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
