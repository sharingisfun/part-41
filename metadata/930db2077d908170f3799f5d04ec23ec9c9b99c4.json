The frequency shifter algorithm is inspired by the classic Bode Frequency Shifter (named after its inventor Harald Bode). The difference between a frequency shifter and a pitch shifter is that it shifts the audio spectrum linearly. E.g. an overtone series of 100, 200, 300 Hz can be shifted by 50 Hz to 150, 250, 350 Hz, making the overtones inharmonic. This effect in itself is great for creating metallic bell timbres, but putting it inside a delayed feedback loop opens up many other possibilities. \n\n\n\nCode:\nRequirements\n\n\nThe minimum requirements for installing and running Echobode under Microsoft Windows\nare:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Microsoft Windows XP or later\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A host application that supports 32-bit or 64-bit VST 2.4 plug-ins\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 1GHz Pentium IV or equivalent\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 5MB of free disk space\n\n\n\nInstall\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install.\n3.Replace files with our cracked ones.\n4.Run the plugin and start registration.\n5.Input your (fake) name, (fake) email and any serials, then register.\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it!
