I plan to seed forever, unless there is a hardware or ISP problem, which usually end up being temporary.  My upload speed is not very fast, so bear with it until there are more seeds.\n\n\nClub Life came to an end on Radio 538 in February with episode 204.  The month of March (205-208) are unofficial episodes, and technically, the episode numbers were supposed to start over at 001 on 3FM in April starting with what is known as 209 here in torrent land. Rather than rocking the boat, I just continued rolling with what the Internet provided, so there you go.\n\n\nThe episodes in this bundle are sourced from DJLellone here on TPB.  As long as seeds stick around, bundles tend to survive longer than single torrents, and are more convenient to download as well.\n\n\nTrackers used:\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce &lt;-- primary\nudp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce\nudp://tracker.ccc.de:80/announce\nudp://tracker.istole.it:80/announce\n\nand of course, DHT and PEX.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bfa81c15590f1612452b2ea29cb11ef5805006b","amp;dn":"Tiesto+Club+Life+201-225","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bfa81c15590f1612452b2ea29cb11ef5805006b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,250,129,193,85,144,241,97,36,82,178,234,41,203,17,239,88,5,0,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
