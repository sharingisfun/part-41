The singer-songwriter has announced plans to issue a 15-track, double-album called Live, which will hit retailers on Sept. 23.\n\n\n\nAccording to a press release, fans can pre-order the album now on Amazon, iTunes and garyclarkjr.com and get an instant download of Ã¢â‚¬Å“When My Train Pulls.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The record is available in vinyl, CD, and digital formats.\n\n\n\nClarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music spans several genres, from hard rock to soul to blues. Proof of his diverse musical talents came at the 2014 Grammy Awards, where he was nominated in both the Rock and R&amp;B fields, a feat that almost never happens in this era of strict genre boundaries.\n\n\n\nClark won the Grammy for Best Traditional R&amp;B performance for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Please Come HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and was a contender for Best Rock Song for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ain't Messin Round.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He also won Contemporary Blues Male Artist of the Year at the 2014 Blues Music Awards.\n\n\n\nThe 30-year-old told ESPN how he describes his live show. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It's a nice, wild ride for an hour and a half or two hours. There is just something about letting go and being in the moment, as loud as it is, and as wild as it is with the lights and everything, it calms me more than anything else in the world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nClark has played with superstars from across the musical spectrum. He admitted to being in awe when he was asked to perform on stage with the Rolling Stones.\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I'm standing up there and all of these guys are looking at me, and I'm singing in the same microphone as Mick Jagger, and I cannot believe it,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he told ESPN. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have to play it cool and be professional, but inside I'm freaking out because I can't believe it's happening. It's a dream come true.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nLive will be ClarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album since 2012Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Blak and Blu, which debuted at No. 6 and established the singer as a bona fide star.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84241f08e18c1a12f64585a881bf57b88463f17e","amp;dn":"Gary+Clark+Jr+-+Gary+Clark+Jr+Live+2CD+%282014%29+WEB+FLAC+Beolab170","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84241f08e18c1a12f64585a881bf57b88463f17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,36,31,8,225,140,26,18,246,69,133,168,129,191,87,184,132,99,241,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
