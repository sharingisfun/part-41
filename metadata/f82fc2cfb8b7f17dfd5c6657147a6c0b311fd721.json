What a shambles. AS a retired Raytheon Engineer in computer memories this was nonsense to me. In his own mind Mike I am sure knows his stuff but the way he goes about it is not planned. He should have been more explicit on the family tree when setting up the IDE and the Hi-Lite compiler. Start with a simple program let us all know what each line means. Also in one sentence tell us all that the Tristate register is programmed to either transmit or receive data and the ordinary port can be programmed to send or receive all or selected bits.A better buy is the CD one can buy from the UK which has on the CD the IDE , Compiler and excellent tutorial down to the nitties. I tried to contact Mike but Nada reply.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f82fc2cfb8b7f17dfd5c6657147a6c0b311fd721","amp;dn":"PICmicro+Microcontroller+Pocket+Reference","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f82fc2cfb8b7f17dfd5c6657147a6c0b311fd721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,47,194,207,184,183,241,125,253,92,102,87,20,122,108,11,49,31,215,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
