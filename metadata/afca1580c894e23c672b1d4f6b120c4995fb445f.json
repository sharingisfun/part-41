Today, modern civilization is wholly dependent on the production and distribution of power. Without it, our way of life would be extinguished.\n\nIn Lights On!, Mark Denny reveals the mysterious world of power generation. He takes us on a fun tour, examining the nature of energy, tracing the history of power generation, explaining the processes from production through transmission to use, and addressing questions that are currently in the headlines, such as:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Is natural gas the best alternative energy source in the near term? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Could solar power be the answer to all our problems? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Why is nuclear power such a hard sell, and are the concerns valid?\n\nDevoting individual chapters to each of the forms of power in use todayÃ¢â‚¬â€electrical, coal, oil and natural gas, hydro, nuclear, and solarÃ¢â‚¬â€Denny explains the pros and cons of each, their availability worldwide, and which are in dwindling supply. Making clear that his approach is that of &quot;a scientist and engineer, not a politician or businessman,&quot; Denny addresses environmental concerns by providing information to help readers understand the science and engineering of power generation so they can discuss contemporary energy issues from an informed perspective. For those who wish to delve deeper into the science, a technical appendix provides estimations for a variety of power generators.\nAnyone who is interested in how energy works and how it is transformed to power our lives will get a charge out of Lights On!\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/ce/45/9229c0a398a0b047ec1b1210.L._V192467999_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/ce/45/9229c0a398a0b047ec1b1210.L._V192467999_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nMark Denny was born in Yorkshire, England, in 1953. He obtained a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Edinburgh University, Scotland, and spent twenty years working as a radar and sonar systems engineer in the aerospace industry. He began writing popular science books in 2005. &quot;I was emailed one day, out of the blue, by the editor-in-chief at Johns Hopkins University Press who had read some of my papers, and who thought they would make an interesting popular science book. I haven't looked back--explaining science, in a way that non-scientists can appreciate, is what I do.&quot; Mark lives on Vancouver Island with his wife, Jane, and spents his time writing, birding, and homebrewing beer. He is author of a number of popular science books, most recently Gliding for Gold: The Physics of Winter Sports and The Science of Navigation: From Dead Reckoning to GPS, both published by Johns Hopkins.
