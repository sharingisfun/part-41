They had a number of top ten hits in the British charts in the early 1980s. Formed in late 1981 by former Depeche Mode songwriter Vince Clarke (synthesizer) and English singer Alison Moyet (vocals), Yazoo was signed to Mute Records in the United Kingdom and (as &quot;Yaz&quot;) to Sire Records in the United States.\n\nYazoo's debut single &quot;Only You&quot; backed with &quot;Situation,&quot; was released on 15 March 1982 and rose to number two in the UK charts. Yazoo released two successful studio albums, Upstairs at Eric's in 1982 and You and Me Both in 1983. Shortly after, Moyet and Clarke decided to break up. Moyet pursued a solo career while Clarke went on to form Erasure, another synth pop duo. Yazoo temporarily reunited in 2008 with a tour in Europe and the United States and the release of a four-disc box set.\n\nThough short-lived, Yazoo continues to influence and inspire many of today's bands, including LCD Soundsystem, Gil Mantera's Party Dream, Hercules and Love Affair, Shiny Toy Guns, Blaqk Audio, La Roux and many, many more\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2010 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc78ebb931ccc042c3b16d9feb570d7f7403dc82","amp;dn":"Yazoo+-+Nobody%5C%27s+Diary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc78ebb931ccc042c3b16d9feb570d7f7403dc82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,120,235,185,49,204,192,66,195,177,109,159,235,87,13,127,116,3,220,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
