The aim is obviously to change my mind but the listener as he did not propose Dickens mistakes but remembering positively and giving the listener an optimistic perspective. \nDex Homne fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ is a Italian DJ from Bologna born artistically with Funk and passed at House music in the early years of independent Chicago since 1986 to 89, knows BNUT flows headlong  and enters in the Hip Hop Bolognese scene with his &quot;socio&quot; participating in jam and freestyles to publish an album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œla direzione ed il metodo parte 1Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° - la lottaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \nFamily and work bring the two work more less together without neglecting the friendship that increases as set the frequency of their work. \nRelegated to a working studio production and remix compilation has clearly become the main valve to vent artistic especially since the birth of second child and related commitments. \nThis CD is completely dedicated to Bario a.k.a. BNUT because I imagined a dance floor full of kids like BNUT jumping and dancing breakdance like him and unfortunately not always the people are with the same desire to dance.\n\nkeep the heads moving !!!\n\ntracklist:\n\nWalter Murphy - A Fifth of Beethoven (Soulwax Proudex Edit)\nBeastie Boys vs. Herbie Hancock - Re-edit/Mash Up\nRun DMC - Peter Piper\nM|A|R|R|S - Pump Up the Volume\nAfrika Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force - Planet Rock\nDave Spoon - 88\nMiguel Picasso &amp; Alex Gomez - Don't Stop\nBuy Now - Body Crash \n2 Many DJ's - Beatles vs Kraftwerk (Eleanor Rigby &amp; Numbers)\nAphex Twin - Window Licker\nMGMT - Kids (Soulwax Remix)\nKings of Leon - My Party (Kenna &amp; Chad Hugo Remix)\nTiga and Zyntherius - Sunglasses at Night\nBoy 8-Bit - Ghost House (Suspense Is Killing Me Pt II)\nAlex Gopher - Aurora\nKid Cudi - Day 'N' Nite (Crookers Remix)\nMr Oizo - Positif \nZZT - The Worm (Erol Remix)\nTiga - Mind Dimension\nThe Rogue Element - Sidewinder \nDaft Punk - Harder Better Faster Stronger (Proudex Edit)\n\nenjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a76ccb9b09cf42055776b9de809a61e0b43ca36","amp;dn":"Breakdance+%28Needles+Under+Torture%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a76ccb9b09cf42055776b9de809a61e0b43ca36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,118,204,185,176,156,244,32,85,119,107,157,232,9,166,30,11,67,202,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
