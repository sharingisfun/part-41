In June 1410 King Wladislaw Jagiello of Poland invaded the OrderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s territory with a powerful allied army including all the enemies of the Teutonic Knights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Poles, Lithuanians, Russians, Bohemians, Hungarians, Tartars and Cossacks. This book recounts how, when the armies clashed on the wooded, rolling hills near the small village of Tannenberg, the Teutonic Knights suffered a disastrous defeat from which their Order never recovered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:320c69c05a89b0d9b88a128b0c7b6163fef7dddc","amp;dn":"Tannenberg+1410%3A+Disaster+for+the+Teutonic+Knights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"320c69c05a89b0d9b88a128b0c7b6163fef7dddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,12,105,192,90,137,176,217,184,138,18,139,12,123,97,99,254,247,221,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
