Goodman was a polymath: a poet, essayist, playwright, and psychotherapist. He was candid about his bisexuality while maintaining a marriage and raising two children. Jonathan Lee weaves together old and new footage of those who extol GoodmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s virtues, as well as his adamant detractors (often one and the same), including Grace Paley, Ned Rorem, Deborah Meier, William F. Buckley, Susan Sontag, and Judith Malina. An abrasive and contradictory figure, GoodmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence was nonetheless immense. Today, much of what passes as common knowledge in the fields of education, politics, psychology, urban planning, civil rights, and sexual politics was first posited by him nearly half a century ago.\n\nGenre: Documentary | Biography | Drama | History\nIMDB rating: 6.6/10\nDirected by: Jonathan Lee\nStarring: Paul Goodman\n\nRelease Name: Paul.Goodman.Changed.My.Life.2011.LiMiTED.DOCU.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS\nSize: 700MB\nVideo: XviD, 512Ãƒâ€”384, 29.970fps\nAudio: English, MP3, 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 01:29:46\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.scenespeeds.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7651ec76417d305f51d138baeb45745c675e4fb3","amp;dn":"Paul+Goodman+Changed+My+Life+2011+LiMiTED+DOCU+DVDRip+XviD-NODLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7651ec76417d305f51d138baeb45745c675e4fb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,81,236,118,65,125,48,95,81,209,56,186,235,69,116,92,103,94,79,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
