For instance it provides the reader with useful places to go for shopping, sightseeing, the beaches in Hong Kong etc. It is a book that provides language learning, culture, idioms, slang expressions and is therefore a very comprehensive book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be8e35271ae1fa735ac98fa58a768183de6bbd0b","amp;dn":"Amy+Leung+-+No+Sweat+Cantonese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be8e35271ae1fa735ac98fa58a768183de6bbd0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,142,53,39,26,225,250,115,90,201,143,165,138,118,129,131,222,107,189,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
