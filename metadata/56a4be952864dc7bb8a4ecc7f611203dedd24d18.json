In addition to the &quot;Tower of Power on speed&quot; energies that have earned them various awards, critical accolades, and a devoted following, this collection boasts dashes of funk, soul, the inimitable saxman Rich Lataille, and the crisp guitar excitement of Chris Vachon. At the forefront is the raspy vocal believability of Mac Odom. It's always interesting how the best blues bands can make songs of despair sound so joyous, but Roomful of Blues also takes a few more wistful looks at romance. The feisty opener &quot;Roll Me Over&quot; is about finding ways to keep the dying flame from burning out completely; Vachon's wailing solo punctuates the energy the &quot;protagonist&quot; puts into the effort. &quot;Love to Watch You When You Go&quot; has a blast watching a lover strut out the door. The punchy rocker &quot;The Salt of My Tears&quot; is about the most cheerful song about loneliness you'll ever hear. &quot;Your Love Was Never There&quot; captures the classic Stax soul sound beautifully, while &quot;Wait and See&quot; has a little boogie-woogie element. The closer, &quot;Where's Bubba?,&quot; is original but sounds like a sly cover of any sassy big-band number ever written.\n - Review by Jonathan Widran, allmusic.com\n\n\n\nRoomful Of Blues - Watch You When You Go\nLabel: Bullseye Blues &amp; Jazz - 11661-9638-2\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: US\nReleased: 2001\nGenre: Blues\nStyle: Chicago Blues\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 \tRoll Me Over \t4:00\n2 \tThe Salt Of My Tears \t3:46\n3 \tYou Give Me Nothin' But The Blues \t3:05\n4 \tYour Love Was Never There \t4:31\n5 \tWatch You When You Go \t3:40\n6 \tOver My Head \t4:03\n7 \tBacklash \t5:42\n8 \tFair Weather Friend \t4:34\n9 \tWait And See \t2:58\n10 \tWhere's Bubba? \t5:30\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nBob Enos - Trumpet\nThomas Enright - Bass\nRich Lataille - Sax (Tenor)\nChris Lemp - Drums\nMac Odom - Vocals\nChris Vachon - Guitar\nHank Walther - Keyboards \nRay Gennari - Trombone\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a4be952864dc7bb8a4ecc7f611203dedd24d18","amp;dn":"Roomful+of+Blues+-+Watch+You+When+You+Go+%282001%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a4be952864dc7bb8a4ecc7f611203dedd24d18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,164,190,149,40,100,220,123,184,164,236,199,246,17,32,61,237,210,77,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
