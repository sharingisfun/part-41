It's not a VPN, just a kind of desktop webcam. You can broadcast what you're doing on your computer, along with some technical infos from your computer (RAM, iTunes playing, uptimes, etc...)\n\nTotally useless so definetly useful :)\n\nPS- I'm running it now. You can watch my DT at http://82.234.25.75:4242/\n\nPPS- If someone know where I can find a tutorial or explanation how to set up a personnalised layout, please let me know!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9892581480dbdea3b7d649c81723b20284e6b3","amp;dn":"Spy+osX+v1.2+beta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9892581480dbdea3b7d649c81723b20284e6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,152,146,88,20,128,219,222,163,183,214,73,200,23,35,178,2,132,230,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
