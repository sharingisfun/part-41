His people could do nothing to help him, and could do nothing to stop the burning. They all watched in horror as the great covenant of over a thousand years between the Twin Cities had come to utter desolation.\\&quot;\n\nThe covenant between the twin desert cities of Iza-KiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªrre and Ben-KiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªrre is broken and their war is feared to be a prophetic sign that the Moncoin has returned.\n\nTarkanyon the Outlander has been tasked to forge peace between the cities. But when he is embroiled in events that include the return of the Wealth; events that hint that he, himself, may have this ancient magic; his mission becomes filled with more questions and answers as nothing is truly as it seems.\n\nWhen Twins War is a mix of classic Western fantasy with Arabian Nights adventure and a unique African edge.
