Sunden, a Michigan roots and blues harmonica player whose reverence for the form doesn't prevent him from having a whole lot of fun on Long Way to Memphis, his debut album. There is a wonderful, back-porch feel on this disc, but its seemingly loose style actually belies some crisp ensemble playing, and what may appear haphazard here is actually calculatingly exact. This is a hard road to walk, between casual and precise, but it works here, and Long Way to Memphis has charm to burn. Highlights include &quot;The Colin Shuffle,&quot; which features some fine guitar from Alonzo Pennington and the marvelous vocal interplay between Michigan Mark DePree and Sara Q on &quot;The Cornbread Jinx.&quot; A paean to songwriter Lucy Webster's feet called, amazingly enough, &quot;Lucy's Feet,&quot; works surprisingly well, given the odds. A sample of harmonica wizard DeFord Bailey &quot;doing his train&quot; opens &quot;The Miracle Stop,&quot; which is perhaps the most impressive track here. There are harmonicas everywhere on these songs, of course, but it would be wrong to call this a harmonica album. It really feels like a personal journey through American roots music with a man who just happens to always carry his harps, just in case.
