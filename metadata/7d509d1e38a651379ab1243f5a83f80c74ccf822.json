It is based on the controversial German play Spring Awakening (1891) by Frank Wedekind which was banned in Germany for some time due to its frank portrayal of abortion, homosexuality, rape, child abuse and suicide. Set in late-19th century Germany, the musical tells the story of teenagers discovering the inner and outer tumult of sexuality. In the musical, alternative rock is employed as part of the folk-infused rock score.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Awakening&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Awakening&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d509d1e38a651379ab1243f5a83f80c74ccf822","amp;dn":"Spring+Awakening+-+Musical+-+Full+Script","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d509d1e38a651379ab1243f5a83f80c74ccf822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,80,157,30,56,166,81,55,154,177,36,63,90,131,248,12,116,204,248,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
