After further review I have come to the conclusion that it's a bootleg show from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida from September 1999 that I most likely went to.\n\n\nI got the idea to share this fromwho knew people still cared about them? Clearly I did the night I found myself googling whilst listening to all of my old emo (post and pre) records. Too bad I don't have a Braid bootleg. That would make me uber-alt.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:559e1b0e62a4a5ccde171044da0d4aca97968a39","amp;dn":"The+Get+Up+Kids+-+Live+Bootleg+Sept+1999+Florida+also+some+live+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"559e1b0e62a4a5ccde171044da0d4aca97968a39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,158,27,14,98,164,165,204,222,23,16,68,218,13,74,202,151,150,138,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
