Food. Often, though, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re like the hungry ghosts of Taoist lore, eating mindlessly, wandering aimlessly, and wanting more Ã¢â‚¬â€ more than food itself can provide. Ellen Kanner believes that if we put in a little thought and preparation, every meal can feed not only our bodies but our souls and our communities as well. Warm, wicked, and one-of-a-kind, Ellen offers an irreverent approach to bringing reverence into daily living Ã¢â‚¬â€ and eating. She presents global vegan recipes that call you to the table, stories that make you stand up and cheer, and gentle nudges that aim to serve up what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hungry for: a more vital self, more loving and meaningful connections, a nourished and nourishing world, and great food, too. Feeding the Hungry Ghost will challenge you to decide: keep reading or start cooking?\n\nAbout the Author\nEllen Kanner is an award-winning food writer, Huggington PostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Meatless Monday blogger, and the syndicated columnist the Edgy Veggie.
