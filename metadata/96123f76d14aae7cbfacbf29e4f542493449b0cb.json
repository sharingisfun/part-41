To obtain the funds, Brit and Candy rob a fast food restaurant using hammers and realistic-looking squirt guns, with Cotty as the getaway driver. Faith, a Christian and the most innocent of the group, is taken aback by Brit and Candy's actions; however, she overlooks their crimes and travels to Florida with them.\n\nOn the trip, the girls attend wild beach parties, engaging in drinking and reckless behavior. After a rambunctious party, they are arrested and bailed out by Alien, a rapper and gangster from St. Petersburg. Faith becomes uncomfortable with Alien's surroundings and lifestyle; she decides to leave, begging the girls to come with her. Despite her pleas, Brit, Candy and Cotty return to Alien's mansion and become part of his crime ring. At a strip club, Alien runs into his rival Big Arch, who warns Alien to stop selling drugs in his territory. Alien ignores him and, in retaliation, Big Arch executes a drive-by shooting on Alien's car. Cotty is shot in the arm during the confrontation and decides to return home.\n\nWith Cotty gone, Alien, Brit and Candy begin a sexual relationship and decide to take revenge on Big Arch. They go to his waterfront mansion in Alien's boat, but Alien is subsequently killed. Brit and Candy kill Big Arch and his men, leaving their signature pink ski masks in the water by the dock. The girls kiss Alien's dead body, then leave Florida in Big Arch's Lamborghini.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96123f76d14aae7cbfacbf29e4f542493449b0cb","amp;dn":"Spring+Breakers+XVID.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96123f76d14aae7cbfacbf29e4f542493449b0cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,18,63,118,209,74,174,124,191,172,191,41,228,245,66,73,52,73,176,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
