The Film is based on the short story Anita G. (1962), which is also by Alexander Kluge. The film tells the story of Anita G., a young East German migrant to West Germany and her struggle to adjust to her new life. The film won a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, whereas Kluge\\'s next film, Artists Under the Big Top: Perplexed even went on to win the Golden Lion, a political scandal due to its progressive leanings which resulted in no Golden Lions being awarded up to 1979. \n\n\nSoft-subbed English\n\nThanks for seeding this fine example of German New Cinema!
