He offers compelling evidence that belief in racial equality is the modern scientific equivalent of believing that the earth is flat. Duke offers proof that the disciples of the new religion of racial egalitarianism have suppressed the evidence of racial differences in the mass media. In a startling chapter, he reveals how AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Founding Fathers, including the man who wrote the Declaration of Independence and who gave us our ConstitutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bill of Rights, Thomas Jefferson, had opinions on race opposite to what is popularly perceived. David Duke goes on to show the irrepressible influence of race on the rise and fall of civilizations, and why the changing racial demographics of America and Europe, if left unchecked, will destroy the values and viability of Western Civilization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e21cf1c69e87da85605a68287cfd8058a5ce9cfd","amp;dn":"Race%2C+IQ+and+Reality+tpb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e21cf1c69e87da85605a68287cfd8058a5ce9cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,28,241,198,158,135,218,133,96,90,104,40,124,253,128,88,165,206,156,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
