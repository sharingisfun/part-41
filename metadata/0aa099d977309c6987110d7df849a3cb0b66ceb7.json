The &quot;killing,&quot; however, is merely a ruse set up to allow army agent Johnny Drum (Cameron) to infiltrate a gang of highway robbers. The gang is led by Whit Lacey (Forrest Tucker), and although Johnny is determined to bring Whit and his men to justice, he cannot help befriending the charming rascal. It all comes to a head when the Sioux attack the local fort and both Johnny and Whit prove that they at least have something in common -- bravery and loyalty. Ilona Massey, as Cameron's love interest, performs &quot;Walking Down Broadway,&quot; by William H. Lingard and Charles E. Pratt, and &quot;I'll Sing a Love Song,&quot; with lyrics by Jack Elliott and Aaron Gonzales.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040696/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040696/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:27:15\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 496x384  1.29:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1476 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,26 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa099d977309c6987110d7df849a3cb0b66ceb7","amp;dn":"The+Plunderers%2C+Rod+Cameron+1948+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa099d977309c6987110d7df849a3cb0b66ceb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,160,153,217,119,48,156,105,135,17,13,125,248,73,163,203,11,102,206,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
