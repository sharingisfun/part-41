More &quot;Germanic&quot; in tone and texture than later Ford films, Four Sons is the story of the Bernle family of Bavaria. Mother Bernle (Margaret Mann) dotes upon her four sons Joseph (James Hall), Johann (Charles Morton), Franz (Francis X. Bushman Jr.) and Andres (George Meeker), but is powerless in guiding their destinies. When WW I breaks out, her sons march off to the front: one of the boys fights for the AEF, the others for the Kaiser. The film's most poignant sequence takes place on the battlefield, when one of the sons stumbles upon his mortally wounded brother. Though the dying man's plaintive cries are heard on the Fox Movietone soundtrack, the scene itself is effectively played in pantomime.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Four Sons.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.17 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 36mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 738 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate : 1 578 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.214\n      Stream size : 1.06 GiB (91%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 148 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 160 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 102 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 124 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17.5 --abr 160\n      Language : English\n\nSilent movie with English intertitles; French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.\n\nIMDB: tt0018909\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by amnesiac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ced56ff2c7851f9485e80986328c56e6e05b02","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+Four+Sons+%5B1928%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ced56ff2c7851f9485e80986328c56e6e05b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,206,213,111,242,199,133,31,148,133,232,9,134,50,140,86,230,224,91,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
