Years later (around 2004), the Hoffman brothers famously and acrimoniously split with Deicide mainman Glen Benton, and vowed to start their own band. By 2007 that band was in place, and the old Amon name was brought back to life. Finally, the debut album, Liar In Wait, was released in 2012. No surprises here with the style -- the Hoffmans know their way around a death metal riff and this album is chock full of 'em, while the other guys (vocalist/bassist Jechael and drummer Mike Petrak) put in commendable performances as well. The production could use some work (this is self-released, after all), and there's not of variation here, though that's somewhat typical of the genre. Not a classic, but good enough to uphold the high standards of classic Tampa death metal. \n(Bnrmetal)\n\n\nYear: 1987 - 2012\nCountry: United States\nGenre: Death Metal\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: Various\nSize: 114 MB\n\n\nDiscography:\nAmon - 1987 - Feasting the beast (Demo)\nAmon - 1989 - Sacrificial (Demo)\nAmon - 2012 - Liar In Wait","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e89575c2d31d69b4374389b2066a2abfc11a183","amp;dn":"Amon+-+Discography+%5BMetal%5D+%281987+-+2012%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e89575c2d31d69b4374389b2066a2abfc11a183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,137,87,92,45,49,214,155,67,116,56,155,32,102,162,171,252,17,161,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
