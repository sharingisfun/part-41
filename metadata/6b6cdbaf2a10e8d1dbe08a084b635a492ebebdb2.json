The first 130km of this 161km stage are completely flat before the riders come up against three severe climbs in quick succession. The second climb, the Col de Grosse Pierre has sections at over 15 per cent, and the final climb up to La Mauselaine in Gerardmer is 1.8km long at 10.3 per cent. A day for a breakaway, or could this be the first stage for the favourites to show themselves? Presented by Gary Imlach with analysis from Chris Boardman, commentary by Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen with Ned Boulting the reporter at the roadside.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 2.00 GB\nRun-Time__: 3hours\nContainer_: MKV\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC Main L3.1 832x468 50fps CRF=25 ~1500Kbps\nAudio_____: HE-AAC VBR 2ch 24/48KHz Q=0.24 ~64Kbps\n\ndb.tt/wHGqEnKq\ntwitter[dot]com/JungleBoyNX\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b6cdbaf2a10e8d1dbe08a084b635a492ebebdb2","amp;dn":"ITV.Tour.de.France.2014.Stage.8.Live.PDTV.x264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b6cdbaf2a10e8d1dbe08a084b635a492ebebdb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,108,219,175,42,16,232,209,219,224,138,8,75,99,90,73,46,190,189,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
