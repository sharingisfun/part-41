It seems their friend had unknowingly offered them protection by just being a Grimm. And without him Ã¢â‚¬â€œthe Wesen community has shown the couple how they really feel about interracial marriages. A small example of what Rosalee and her new husband are now facing is the brick that was thrown through the Spice Shop window.
