Banding together with other small farmers and local slaves, Knight launched an uprising that led Jones County, Mississippi to secede from the Confederacy, creating a Free State of Jones. Knight continued his struggle into Reconstruction, distinguishing him as a compelling, if controversial, figure of defiance long beyond the War.\r\n\r\nDirector: Gary Ross\r\n\r\nWriters: Gary Ross\r\n\r\nActors: Matthew McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mahershala Ali, Keri Russell\r\n\r\nGenre: Action and Adventure, Drama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08222bc6495e1baccfb904333285f23c5a42498","amp;dn":"Free+State+of+Jones.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08222bc6495e1baccfb904333285f23c5a42498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,130,34,188,100,149,225,186,204,251,144,67,51,40,95,35,197,164,36,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
