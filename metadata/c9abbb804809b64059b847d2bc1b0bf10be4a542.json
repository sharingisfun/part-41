The elderly curator of the Louvre has been \nmurdered inside the museum, a baffling cipher found near the body. As \nLangdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, sort through the \nbizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the \nwords of Da Vinci?clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by \nthe painter.\n\nThe stakes are raised when Langdon uncovers a startling link: The late \ncurator was involved in the Priory of Sion?an actual secret society whose \nmembers included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, \namong others. Langdon suspects they are on the hunt for a breathtaking \nhistorical secret, one that has proven through the centuries to be as \nenlightening as it is dangerous. In a frantic race through Paris, and beyond, \nLangdon and Neveu find themselves matching wits with a faceless \npowerbroker who appears to anticipate their every move. Unless they can \ndecipher the labyrinthine puzzle, the Priory's secret?and an explosive \nancient truth?will be lost forever.\n\nBreaking the mold of traditional suspense novels, The Da Vinci Code is \nsimultaneously lightning-paced, intelligent, and intricately layered with \nremarkable research and detail. From the opening to the unpredictable and \nstunning conclusion, bestselling author Dan Brown proves himself a master \nstoryteller.\n\n----\n\nDan Brown is the bestselling author of Digital Fortress, Angels &amp; Demons, and \nDeception Point. He lives in New England.\n\n----\n\nPaul Michael has appeared in numerous theater and television productions in \nboth England and Canada. His American television credits include \nappearances on Alias and VIP. He has been nominated twice for an Audie \naward and has recorded over fifty audiobooks.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9abbb804809b64059b847d2bc1b0bf10be4a542","amp;dn":"Dan+Brown+-+The+Da+Vinci+Code+%5BUnabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9abbb804809b64059b847d2bc1b0bf10be4a542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,171,187,128,72,9,182,64,89,184,71,210,188,27,11,241,11,228,165,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
