In Children of the City, David Nasaw re-creates this period in our social history from the vantage point of the children who grew up then. Drawing on hundreds of memoirs, autobiographies, oral histories and unpublished--and until now unexamined--primary source materials from cities across the country, he provides us with a warm and eloquent portrait of these children, their families, their daily lives, their fears, and their dreams.\nIllustrated with 68 photographs from the period, many never before published, Children of the City offers a vibrant protrait of a time when our cities and our grandparents were young.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e8ce3ade708a4288ea004efe8427281aff29790","amp;dn":"Children+of+The+City+-+At+Work+and+Play+%28Essays+Photo+History+US","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e8ce3ade708a4288ea004efe8427281aff29790","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,140,227,173,231,8,164,40,142,160,4,239,232,66,114,129,175,242,151,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
