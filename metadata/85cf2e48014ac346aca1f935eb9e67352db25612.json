But there&amp;#039;s another side to this man that&amp;#039;s in danger of being forgotten - King the raging prophet of God&amp;#039;s judgement on the West, the Baptist pastor who said that his mission was &amp;#039;to redeem the soul of America&amp;#039;.\n\nForty years after his death, politician and campaigner, Oona King, who has strong family links with MLK and the civil rights movement, goes on a journey through the Deep South in search of this aspect of his leadership. Along the way she meets a wide range of Martin Luther King&amp;#039;s friends and colleagues, including his right-hand man, former Ambassador Andrew Young. Armed with her own questions about religion and its role in society, Oona explores with them the deep roots of King&amp;#039;s thought and action. What kind of religion did he believe in? What made him tick? And what do we lose if we ignore King&amp;#039;s spiritual, mystical vision??\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/listings/programme.shtml?day=yesterday&amp;service_id=4224&amp;filename=20080329/20080329_2000_4224_9143_60&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/listings/programme.shtml?day=yesterday&amp;service_id=4224&amp;filename=20080329/20080329_2000_4224_9143_60&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nRetrack:shunster \n\nSource:Thebox .bz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85cf2e48014ac346aca1f935eb9e67352db25612","amp;dn":"Martin+Luther+King%3A+American+Prophet++2008+03+29++%28BBC+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85cf2e48014ac346aca1f935eb9e67352db25612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,207,46,72,1,74,195,70,172,161,249,53,235,158,103,53,45,178,86,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
