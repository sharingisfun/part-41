Here what was told to me and this \nis what I know.\n\nAn intern at WMMR in the 80&amp;#039;s recorded this show to an\nanalog source. Being such a tremendous recording this\nindividual longed to re-record the master reel straight to \na digital source as they became increasingly popular in the\nearly 90&amp;#039;s. At this point the intern had moved on and no \nlonger had this type of access. However, he remembered\nperiodically that the studio or the station allowed access \nto the &amp;#039;records room&amp;#039; for research activity. Posing as a\nuniversity affiliate doing research on 70&amp;#039;s radio advertising\nthis individual gained access to the master reels with a\nportable Sony DAT deck. The room was laid out with shelves \nwith tables on the far end with cassette decks, reel to reel\nand &amp;#039;cart&amp;#039; type recorders. Unplugging the cart recorder and \nconnecting the DAT deck history was then digitized. If you \nlook at the timeline it was more than likely recorded with a \nSony TCD D3. This early DAT deck was actually graced with a \nvery nice A to D chip. I believe the same chip found in the \nPanasonic SV3700. Therefore a very nice digital transcript \nwas made that day.\n\nAt this time I was working at a mail order facility selling \nDAT tapes. Which at the time were very expensive, $12 or more \nper tape. The individual with this Bonnie recording told us \nthe story above. Is it true?  Who knows but he use to buy DAT \ntapes from us regularly. He made us a cassette of this famous \nrecording and we bugged him to make us a DAT copy for months. \nHe did not have the means to do DAT to DAT. On a visit to the \n&amp;#039;store&amp;#039; in Stamford in 1992 we finally were able to make 1 \nDAT clone. I subsequently cloned that DAT. Most likely the \nclone was made between a Panasonic SV3700 and a Sony 59ES. \nBut, possibly between 2 SV3700&amp;#039;s. At the &amp;#039;shop&amp;#039; we had so \nmany DAT decks with many configurations.\n\nI have no doubt this is direct from the Pre-FM Reels and one \nlisten and you will have no doubt either. Easily one of the \nfinest recordings by any musician at any time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2966a00344dab65160d4f2d3e31ddfb6c317143e","amp;dn":"Bonnie+Raitt+-+Sigma+Sound+Philadelphia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2966a00344dab65160d4f2d3e31ddfb6c317143e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,102,160,3,68,218,182,81,96,212,242,211,227,29,223,182,195,23,20,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
