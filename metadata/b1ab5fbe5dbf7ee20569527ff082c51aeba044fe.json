After Zoe is jilted by her fiancÃƒÂ© Jason, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unable to face the pitying looks of her friends and family any longer.\n\nFleeing to America, she is employed as a nanny by the moody, difficult, but devastatingly sexy, single dad Ryan.\nShe quickly wins over his children, but her boss is more of a challenge. Things arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t helped, of course, by her inadvertently displaying her knickers to his colleagues or nearly hospitalising him with a toy bow and arrow.\n\nThank God sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got her colourful circle of friends to keep her sane: fun-loving Trudie, hippy Amber and chilly, tight-lipped Felicity.\nIt is only over time that Zoe and Ryan begin to understand each other and their apparently ill-fated relationship takes on a new dimension. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one problem, as Zoe soon discovers: that the past isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always easy to escape, no matter how far away you go.\n\nGenre: Romance, Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1ab5fbe5dbf7ee20569527ff082c51aeba044fe","amp;dn":"The+Nearly+Weds+by+Jane+Costello","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1ab5fbe5dbf7ee20569527ff082c51aeba044fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,171,95,190,93,191,126,226,5,105,82,127,240,130,197,26,235,160,68,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
