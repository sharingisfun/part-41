Together, they are able to bring art to life and enter paintings at will. Their extraordinary abilities are highly sought after, particularly by a secret group who want to access the terrors called Hollow Earth. All the demons, devils, and evil creatures ever imagined are trapped for eternity in the world of Hollow EarthÃ¢â‚¬â€trapped unless special powers release them.\n\nThe twins flee from London to a remote island off the west coast of Scotland in hopes of escaping their pursuers and gaining the protection of their grandfather, who has powers of his own. But the villains will stop at nothing to find Hollow Earth and harness the powers within. With so much at stake, nowhere is safeÃ¢â‚¬â€and survival might be a fantasy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b9251f3e53a626c8598d682f77d15082918576f","amp;dn":"Hollow+Earth+-+John+Barrowman+%26amp%3B+Carole+E.+Barrowman.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b9251f3e53a626c8598d682f77d15082918576f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,146,81,243,229,58,98,108,133,152,214,130,247,125,21,8,41,24,87,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
