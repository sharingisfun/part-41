Those without a DTS-MA receiver will still be able to play a 24/48 core DTS stream.\n\nFor those who cannot play a disc in AVCHD, there is brief document included in this torrent as to my own process in extracting mono wavs from discs like these in order to create a disc in another multichannel format.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\n\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nThe new Muse. I sincerely doubt you're getting a 5.1 mix this time around from them. Very happy with the mix. Very happy with the album. They're in almost their 00's U2 era, where they've got an established sound which they try to apply to actual songs instead of trying to build a HUGE album. Very mature.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSupremacy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:55\nMadness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:39\nPanic Station Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03\nPrelude Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:03\nSurvival Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:17\nFollow Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:51\nAnimals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:23\nExplorers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:48\nBig Freeze Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:41\nSave Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:09\nLiquid State Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03\nThe 2nd Law: Unsustainable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:48\nThe 2nd Law: Isolated System Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:59\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bedd25c95b0700d21f6d06dd805ca34e3953fe63","amp;dn":"Muse+-+The+2nd+Law+%28SPEC+DTS-MA+5.1+by+DKA%29+%28SBU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bedd25c95b0700d21f6d06dd805ca34e3953fe63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,221,37,201,91,7,0,210,31,109,6,221,128,92,163,78,57,83,254,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
