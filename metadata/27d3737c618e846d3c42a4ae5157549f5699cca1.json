Some are good and honest, others very malicious but no one is more dangerous than Tex Hex the leader of the Carrion Bunch, a group of outlaws under the control of the mysterious group Stampede. Hex seeks to control this immense mineral richness at all costs than is Kerium. Only one person can put a stop on his plans: BraveStarr. When there was an obstacle in the way, BraveStarr called for the power of a particular animal and used that ability to move the obstacle, like using the strength of a bear to move a boulder, or the speed of a puma to catch the criminal, the eyes of a hawk, or the ears of a wolf. To help him in the fight for the cause of justice, he had Thirty-Thirty, his horse that can transform into a human-like creature being able to stand on it's hind legs, talk and fight alongside him. BraveStarr lived in Fort Kerium. His advisor was the wise, elderly Shaman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27d3737c618e846d3c42a4ae5157549f5699cca1","amp;dn":"BraveStarr+Ep.+12-22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27d3737c618e846d3c42a4ae5157549f5699cca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,211,115,124,97,142,132,109,60,66,164,174,81,87,84,159,86,153,204,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
