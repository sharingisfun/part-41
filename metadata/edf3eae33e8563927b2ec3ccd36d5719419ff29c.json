The well known controversies are all there: Whitewater, Travelgate and the death of her law partner Vince Foster. There is also a chapter devoted to the criticizing Hillary's proposed healthcare program (known as &quot;Hillarycare&quot;). But there are some less discussed scandals such as &quot;Cattlegate&quot;, which involved Hillary's investment in cattle futures while her husband was a rising star in Arkansas politics. Published at a time when Hillary made her first senate run it collects all the scandals of her husband's presidency and her early legal career and focuses on whatever role she was supposed to have had in them. Josi has written not only an important book for the future of America, but also a fascinating account you will find hard to put down. 90 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf3eae33e8563927b2ec3ccd36d5719419ff29c","amp;dn":"Josi-Hillary+Clinton-What+Everyone+Should+Know%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf3eae33e8563927b2ec3ccd36d5719419ff29c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,243,234,227,62,133,99,146,123,46,195,204,211,109,87,25,65,159,242,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
