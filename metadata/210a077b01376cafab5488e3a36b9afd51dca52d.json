Mason's adventure yarn The Four Feathers relies heavily on stock footage taken from the more famous 1939 adaptation (both were produced by Alexander Korda and codirected by Korda's brother Zoltan). Anthony Steel stars as 19th cntury British officer Harry Faversham, who begs off from serving with Kitchener's forces in the Sudan, preferring to stay in London with fiancee Mary Burroughs (Mary Ure). Almost immediately, Faversham receives the traditional &quot;white feather&quot; of cowardice from his three closest friends--and then is handed a fourth feather by Mary. Determined to prove that he is not a coward, Faversham heads off to the Sudan to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with his comrades. He also intends to return those dreaded feathers to his three former friends, even resorting to native disguise at one point to do so.\n \nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nHarry Faversham, um ano apÃƒÂ³s a morte de seu pai, ÃƒÂ© alistado sob o comando de um general para vingar a morte de outro oficial no SudÃƒÂ£o","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:210a077b01376cafab5488e3a36b9afd51dca52d","amp;dn":"Storm+Over+the+Nile+%5BLaurence+Harvey%5D+%281955%29+DVDRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"210a077b01376cafab5488e3a36b9afd51dca52d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,10,7,123,1,55,108,175,171,84,136,227,163,107,154,253,81,220,165,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
