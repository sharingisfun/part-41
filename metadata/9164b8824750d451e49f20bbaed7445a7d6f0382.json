But while many books talk about libertarian ideas, none until now has explored the history of this uniquely American movementÃ¢â‚¬â€where and who it came from, how it evolved, and what impact it has had on our country.\n\nIn this revelatory book, based on original research and interviews with more than 100 key sources, Brian Doherty traces the evolution of the movement through the unconventional life stories of its most influential leadersÃ¢â‚¬â€ Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard, and Milton FriedmanÃ¢â‚¬â€and through the personal battles, character flaws, love affairs, and historical events that altered its course. And by doing so, he provides a fascinating new perspective on American historyÃ¢â‚¬â€from the New Deal through the culture wars of the 1960s to today's most divisive political issues. Neither an exposÃƒÂ© nor a political polemic, this entertaining historical narrative will enlighten anyone interested in American politics.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Brian Doherty is a senior editor at Reason magazine.
