Jazz itself has the greatest potential\nto transform itself as a genre as it has a certain semblance of civility and\nof a decorum awareness(as it were)that is healthy in a sensible old fashioned\nconscious society where nuances of polite discourse are encouraged with\nbackground music that is intended to suit the occasion hopefully to do it\njustice as it were.\n\nThat said, I have some beefs with Jazz as its currently implemented by all\ntoo many composers and their artists per se.\n\nI hate to have to point this out however there appears a clear and persistent\nstyle within the Jazz community of what amounts to obfuscation of the essential\nmelody or song as it were into what become meaningless sounds instead - that\nare simply &quot;stringing you along&quot; with all the essence removed sort of\ndecaffeinated coffee as it were - while you sit there waiting instead to be\nawoken by some hint that there is beauty and great spirit in what you are being\nmade to listen to - only you already know the formula is doomed to fail as\nwithout the caffeine the coffee will never be convincing as better tasting if\nyou want it for the effect its intended to have - a stimulant in fact and \nsomething with which to awaken the senses to better absorb reality than to\nbe lost in what is instead a fraud or perhaps simply a ruse when it need \nnot be so at all.\n\nWhen Cole Porter songs are sung to normal musical accompaniment as it were,\nthere are certainly some great tunes and great melodies and words in what is\nthe combination of what we call a great songs that are heard sung. Its Cole\nPorter etc and its potentially great stuff of the genre of music from which\nit comes.\n\nOn the other hand, witness the effect of the composer to Cole Porter's songs\nin these Jazzy renditions by Oscar Peterson instead. Complete whitewash I say!\n\nJazz too often is implemented so that the original tune becomes retardedly\nlost, with pauses in the music pace as its played in insane belabor, sounds\nat times too inanely repetitive as to be an infliction onto the sensibilities\nthat once again defy logic of good sense (pardon the alliteration if you will\nin my own comments here) and for the idea of being somewhat in a constant state\nof &quot;cathartic anticipation' yet never achieving any sort of climax as a tease it\nall it turns out to be time and time again over decades of having to hear the \ngenre in expectation that perhaps it has improved. Sounds that are dragged out\nforever as though the composer hasn't yet made a connection to earth\nand is beaming his rays from beyond as it were.\n\nPerhaps Jazz should merge with Disco (just kiddin) - in fact the style of \nballad singing in great old fashioned taste could simply be &quot;jazzed up&quot; somewhat\nby the choice of the different sounds (staying within a range of what we are used\nto however, from traditional showtune genre perhaps). So if you hear Danny boy\nor The Sound of music - put to jazz - it should remain the real thing rather\nthan sacrificed to some other idea of good - a retarded rendition lost of all\nmeaning devoid of competence and integrity - simply pawned off on the contrary\nby folks that have yet to be told - the emperor has no clothes on  when he makes\nsuch choices and we should all have to go along. Jazz should no more retard\na song than having it put the piano in complete normal interpretation of the \nmusic at source.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo \n\n\n\nCD back image with tracks shown\nOscar Peterson Trio - 01 - In The Still Of The Night (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 02 - It's All Right With Me (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 03 - Love For Sale (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 04 - Just One Of Those Things (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 05 - I've Got You Under My Skin (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 06 - Every Time We Say Goodbye (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 07 - Night And Day (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 08 - Easy To Love (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 09 - Why Can't You Behave (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 10 - I Love Paris (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 11 - I Concentrate On You (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 12 - It's De Lovely (flac file conversion)\nOscar Peterson Trio - 13 - I Get A Kick Out Of You (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 14 - Just One Of Those Things (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 15 - Love For Sale (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 16 - Let's Do It (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 17 - Night And Day (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 18 - What Is This Thing Called Love (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 19 - Anything Goes (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 20 - I've Got You Under My Skin (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 21 - I Love You (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 22 - In The Still Of The Night (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 23 - Every Time We Say Goodbye (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 24 - Begin The Beguine (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\nOscar Peterson Trio - 25 - So Near And Yet So Far (flac file conversion) cd bonus track\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404f06dfcab67508e781947eeae8313bee0a03d1","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+Trio+Cole+Porter+Songbook+320k+%28musicfromrizzo%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404f06dfcab67508e781947eeae8313bee0a03d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,79,6,223,202,182,117,8,231,129,148,126,234,232,49,59,238,10,3,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
