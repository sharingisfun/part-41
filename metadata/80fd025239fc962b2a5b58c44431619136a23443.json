As attention-grabbing in its design as it is in its content, this bold volume outlines the laws of power in their unvarnished essence, synthesizing the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun-tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, and other great thinkers. Some laws require prudence (&quot;Law 1: Never Outshine the Master&quot;), some stealth (&quot;Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions&quot;), and some the total absence of mercy (&quot;Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally&quot;) but like it or not, all have applications in real-life situations. Illustrated through the tactics of Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, P. T. Barnum, and other famous figures who have wielded -- or been victimized by -- power, these laws will fascinate any reader interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control.\n\nIf you like this, buy the hard-copy by Robert Greene. =]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80fd025239fc962b2a5b58c44431619136a23443","amp;dn":"The+48+Laws+of+Power+-+Robert+Greene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80fd025239fc962b2a5b58c44431619136a23443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,253,2,82,57,252,150,43,42,91,88,196,68,49,97,145,54,162,52,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
