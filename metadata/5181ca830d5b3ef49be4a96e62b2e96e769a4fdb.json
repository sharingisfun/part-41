Total\n\n\nThis is a recording I did as a kid back on Sept. 24th 1987. The station was KNX 1070 news radio out of Los Angeles and they would play &quot;old time radio shows&quot; also known as &quot;OTR&quot;. Show would run 1 hour from 9pm to 10pm and repeat at 2am seven days a week. These were recorded on a huge Goldstar boombox at my home in Long Beach California.\nI have a couple more tapes of the drama hour to upload also so check back.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5181ca830d5b3ef49be4a96e62b2e96e769a4fdb","amp;dn":"Cassette+Tape+Recording+9-23-87+KNX+1070+Los+Angeles+Drama+Hour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5181ca830d5b3ef49be4a96e62b2e96e769a4fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,129,202,131,13,91,62,244,155,228,169,110,98,178,233,110,118,154,79,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
