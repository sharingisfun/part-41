Boyle argues that just as every informed citizen needs to know at least something about the environment or civil rights, every citizen should also understand intellectual property law. Why? Because intellectual property rights mark out the ground rules of the information society, and todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s policies are unbalanced, unsupported by evidence, and often detrimental to cultural access, free speech, digital creativity, and scientific innovation.\n\n\n\n\nBoyle identifies as a major problem the widespread failure to understand the importance of the public domainÃ¢â‚¬â€the realm of material that everyone is free to use and share without permission or fee. The public domain is as vital to innovation and culture as the realm of material protected by intellectual property rights, he asserts, and he calls for a movement akin to the environmental movement to preserve it. With a clear analysis of issues ranging from Jefferson's philosophy of innovation to musical sampling, synthetic biology and Internet file sharing, this timely book brings a positive new perspective to important cultural and legal debates. If we continue to enclose the Ã¢â‚¬Å“commons of the mind,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Boyle argues, we will all be the poorer. \n\nJames Boyle is William Neal Reynolds Professor of Law, Duke University School of Law. He lives in Chapel Hill, NC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681e2bbb764540d3685f5e7becd06763b495ee17","amp;dn":"James+Boyle+-+Public+Domain+mp3+variable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681e2bbb764540d3685f5e7becd06763b495ee17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,30,43,187,118,69,64,211,104,95,94,123,236,208,103,99,180,149,238,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
