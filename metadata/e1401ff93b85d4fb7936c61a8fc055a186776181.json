His radical reworking of songs by Bruce Springsteen, Joy Division and others, along with his own delicate neo-folk music, have made GonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez a gold-selling artist in his native Sweden and an indie favorite in the U.S. Hear GonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez in a full concert, recorded live from Washington, D.C.\n\nGonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez is on tour in support of his new album, In Our Nature, which is his first full-length release in four years. Fans of quiet rainy-day music fell in love with GonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez\\&amp;#039;s previous album, Veneer, a beautifully crafted collection of cover tunes and originals that showed GonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez to be a gifted fingerstyle guitarist with a mesmerizing voice. Songs from Veneer, including the popular \\&quot;Heartbeats,\\&quot; appeared on TV shows and in commercials.\n\nGonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez was born in Gothburg, Sweden, to Argentine parents in 1978. He grew up listening to classical music, bossa nova and Western pop. \\&quot;We always had a guitar at home,\\&quot; GonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez says in an interview with NPR\\&amp;#039;s Michele Norris. \\&quot;But it wasn\\&amp;#039;t until I was 14 when I picked it up myself when my father handed me these sheets of music of The Beatles and some other classics. That\\&amp;#039;s where I learned all the chords and learned how to play and sing at the same time. All that music kind of lives with you, but I don\\&amp;#039;t go back to it that often.\\&quot;\n\nGonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez is one of the standout artists in a recent wave of new Swedish musicians that\\&amp;#039;s included Peter BjÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶rn and John, The Shout Out Louds, The Concretes and the electro-pop group The Knife. The Knife originally wrote \\&quot;Heartbeats,\\&quot; the song that helped put GonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez on the map.\n\nOther songs GonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez has reinvented include the Joy Division\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart,\\&quot; \\&quot;Born in the U.S.A.\\&quot; by Bruce Springsteen and Kylie Minogue\\&amp;#039;s dance-pop song \\&quot;Hand On Your Heart.\\&quot; \n\n\\&quot;I heard [\\&amp;#039;Hand On Your Heart\\&amp;#039;] a million times before,\\&quot; GonzÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez says. \\&quot;But I was watching TV and saw the video and started listening to the lyrics. And it felt like the production of the whole song and the video didn\\&amp;#039;t match the words. So that was kind of a challenge.\\&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1401ff93b85d4fb7936c61a8fc055a186776181","amp;dn":"Jos%C3%A9+Gonz%C3%A1lez+-+Live+at+The+9.30+club%2C+Washington+%28NPR+version%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1401ff93b85d4fb7936c61a8fc055a186776181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,64,31,249,59,133,212,251,121,54,198,26,143,192,85,161,134,119,97,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
