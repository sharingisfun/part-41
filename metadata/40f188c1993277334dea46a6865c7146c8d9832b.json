Here's another one definitely worth a listen: SPIN Artists of the Year the Black Keys mashed with OutKast rapper Big Boi.\n\n    Aptly-titled The Brothers of Chico Dusty, the mixtape combines two of SPIN's 40 Best Albums of 2010: Big Boi's solo LP Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son Of Chico Dusty and the Keys' Brothers. Whoever's responsible for this gem -- apparently, it's anonymous artist who goes by &quot;Wick-it&quot; -- shouldn't slip back onto the web unrecognized. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã…Â¾\n\n    The Smoking Section -\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ As twisted as the idea sounds, turntabilist Wick-ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ballsy concoction yields pretty surprising results as Antwan Patton sounds like a lost KeysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ band member. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã…Â¾\n\n    The Nashville Scene -\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ Now that The Black Keys live here ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and since ATL is just a hop and a skip from Music City ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to go ahead and claim this one. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a perfect (semi-) local storm. We told you before about how Big Boi thinks local turntablist Wick-It the Instigator is dope. Well, now thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even more reason for a bromance to blossom between the two ballers (It's started). Wick-It has mashed up The Black KeysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Brothers and Big BoiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both of which are already getting a lot of love on year-end best-of lists (just ask GrimeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s).
