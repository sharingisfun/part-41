Elsewhere, she draws on such strong writers as Richard Thompson and Paul Brady, all for a collection devoted to devotion. Song after song expresses passion, usually with happy results -- this is not the album of a woman with the blues. Even when she's dressing down a parent in her own &quot;Circle Dance,&quot; Raitt offers forgiveness and understanding. There, and in other songs, the object of her emotions rarely seems to be perfect, but she takes that in and loves him, anyway. Co-producer Don Was provides a detailed production in which single elements -- an accordion, a harmony vocal by Levon Helm or David Crosby -- effectively color arrangements and complement Raitt's always soulful singing. -- \n William Ruhlmann \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Love sneakin' up on you [03:42] \n 02.Longing in their hearts [04:49] \n 03.You [04:28] \n 04.Cool, clear water [05:28] \n 05.Circle dance [04:11] \n 06.I sho do [03:39] \n 07.Dimming of the day [03:40] \n 08.Feeling of falling [06:17] \n 09.Steal your heart away [05:45] \n 10.Storm warning [04:32] \n 11.Hell to pay [04:04] \n 12.Shadow of doubt [04:27] \n ____ \n \n 55:02 min \n 77,2 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d8152853c7c303aa68d677b55de1486a703a79d","amp;dn":"Bonnie_Raitt-Longing_In_Their_Hearts-%28Retail%29-1994-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d8152853c7c303aa68d677b55de1486a703a79d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,129,82,133,60,124,48,58,166,141,103,123,85,222,20,134,167,3,167,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
