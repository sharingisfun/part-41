Special emphasis is placed on models which are driven by innovations that have a Gaussian mixture distribution. These models are able to flexibly capture the observed non-normality in the distribution of bond yields. It is shown that the theoretical models can easily be cast into the statistical state space form, which provides a convenient framework for statistical inference. An application to US data illustrates the properties of the models and shows the estimation techniques at work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcaf901d8dc614b31d8f513b796f6f1f715e85c8","amp;dn":"Term+Structure+Modeling+and+Estimation+in+a+State+Space+Framewor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcaf901d8dc614b31d8f513b796f6f1f715e85c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,175,144,29,141,198,20,179,29,143,81,59,121,111,111,31,113,94,133,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
