He has to fight the anti-Indian attitudes of his superior officer (Robert Sterling) and North-South tensions within the soldiers. He discovers Confederate sympathisers are planning to cause the Indians to go on the warpath for their own benefit\n\nOf interest to modern viewers is the presence of Dennis Weaver, here cast as Navajo chief Menguito.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.24gb\nDuration.... 01:24:21\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 672\nFrame Height.... 496\nData Rate.... 1931kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 192kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c45a752eccfc4c71be5708da8c95abd97d85da12","amp;dn":"Column+South+1953+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c45a752eccfc4c71be5708da8c95abd97d85da12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,90,117,46,204,252,76,113,190,87,8,218,140,149,171,217,125,133,218,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
