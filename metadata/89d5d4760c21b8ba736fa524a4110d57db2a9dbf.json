For the most part, their confidence is justified, provided at least they stick to the traditional tourist places and pursuits. The most difficulty they are likely to experience is with regional variations in accent and pronunciation, and that variation is true of many countries.\n\nDiscerning tourists may have some awareness of the fact the Highlands of Scotland have a language of their own, Gaelic, that is completely different from English. However, if they think about the language of lowland Scotland at all, they probably assume that this is more or less English with, perhaps, a few dialectal differences. In this they are quite wrong. Historically, Scots is not just a dialect of English. It is a separate language, being rather a cousin of English rather than an offshoot, both languages having their roots in Anglo-Saxon.\n\nThe Scots language became different in several ways from English, having, for example, noticeable vocabulary differences. For example, it was subject to linguistic influences from other languages, such as French, which did not affect English. Scots, however, gradually lost ground to the language of ScotlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more powerful neighbour. This gradual process of anglicization led to Scots being replaced by English as the official language of Scotland. The English language then represented, as it were, the public voice of Scotland, and, as such, also became the chief literary language of Scotland.\n\n\n\n\nGREYFRIARS BOBBY: The Legend of the Little Scottish Dog by Betty Kirkpatrick\n\nGreyfriars Bobby was a little terrier best remembered for his complete and utter loyalty to his owner. When his master died, Bobby took up a more or less constant vigil at his grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. Now BobbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s statue stands guard opposite the gates of the graveyard and is one of EdinburghÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most visited tourist sites. This is Bobby's story.\n\n\n\nHAGGIS, HOGMANAY AND HALLOWEEN by Betty Kirkpatrick\n\nScotland is a beautiful country steeped in history, culture, legend and customs. Many of these customs live on and this little book looks at some of the most important of these, notably: Haggis (Scotland's national dish which is celebrated on Burns' night), Hogmanay, and Halloween.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Tested files out with Calibre and Kindle for PC, and Aldiko and Kindle for Android.
