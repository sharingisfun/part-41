I can&amp;#039;t really see any difference from the February edition, but I like to know that I have the newest version. Maybe you do as well?\n\nI have been using the Rich Jerk&amp;#039;s methods to increase my AdSense revenue, and just find a lot of solutions that are basically like an auto-pilot. You put a little effort in initially and the returns happen automatically thereafter.\n\nInitially I was concerned that he recommends a lot of products, some inexpensive and some pricey...but I suggest trying out a few of the free ones and less expensive tips, until you build up some cash. I&amp;#039;m not filthy rich yet, but along with my real job, I&amp;#039;m making a killing!\n\nI hope you guys enjoy it and can use it to your advantage, now, go make some bank! Follow everything you possibly can in the book, just about everything you invest in from this book will make at least a noteworthy return.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5085ac8d73cee2f4122a594d1fd85f285d6e3b72","amp;dn":"Rich+Jerk+-+Updated+April+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5085ac8d73cee2f4122a594d1fd85f285d6e3b72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,133,172,141,115,206,226,244,18,42,89,77,31,216,95,40,93,110,59,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
