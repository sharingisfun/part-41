I love this show because it teaches kids how to get along with one another in a group and solve problems within that group in an easy to understand way.\n\nManny is a repairman with a toolbox full of talking tools, all of which are cleverly named: for example, the measuring tape is Stretch, the hammer is Pat. Together Manny and his tools take on a variety of jobs, which always require thinking through possible ways of getting them done.\nManny is a Latino, and speaks a mixture of English and Spanish, as do some of the other characters on the show; only one of his tools has a Latino accent -- Felipe, the phillips screwdriver. When other characters greet them, they typically say, &quot;Hola, Manny. Hello, Tools.&quot;\n\n\nIncluded are:\n\n1) amigo grande\n2) not so fast food\n3) rusty to the rescue\n4) The handy mandy music video.( not a episode, but a cute little video)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c7793a596332e47fd3c5975475517693ea218b","amp;dn":"Handy+Manny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0c7793a596332e47fd3c5975475517693ea218b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,199,121,58,89,99,50,228,127,211,197,151,84,117,81,118,147,234,33,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
