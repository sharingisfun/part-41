They don't even attempt to sound original but instead this British quintet trusts the power and aggression of slightly Hardcore-tinged Thrash Metal, which is always appreciated in my book.\n\nThe Alienation Zone is the lads' brand-new 6-song EP, and is all about riffs, more riffs, punk attitude and making fun of certain groups of people (the song &quot;Student Wankers&quot; really doesn't need much explanation, does it?). Suicide Watch love Slayer and Exodus as much as they love early D.R.I. or early Anthrax. They have always had this &quot;mosh-it-up&quot; spirit in their Thrash/Crossover machine and it's worked surprisingly well for the last 10 years, without clogging up the engine with rust or carbon.\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis EP is violent, aggressive and played with an honest, free and easy attitude, with a little additional vocal help from Acid Reign's H (R.I.P.). The first three songs off this EP, &quot;A Good Day to Live (a Better Day to Die),&quot; &quot;The Alienation Zone&quot; and &quot;This Cursed Earth 'Reprise'&quot;, represent the better part of this opus while &quot;Student Wankers&quot; and &quot;Motorbreath&quot; (Metallica cover) are more or less fillers, in my opinion. But whenever Suicide Watch shift into their most brutal Thrash gear, that's when I start feeling most entertained.\nNow, we need a new album from Suicide Watch, as the hunger is growing, thanks to this 6-track appetizer.\nThe Alienation Zone features Ã¢â‚¬ËœHÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ from Acid Reign on vocals on 2 tracks, also includes a cover of MetallicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Motorbreath &amp; a cover of Peter &amp; the Test Tube Babies track Student Wankers.\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nGlobal Warning 2005\nFigure Head of Pain 2009\nThe Culling of Humanity (EP) 2010\nThe Alienation Zone (EP) 2014\n\n\nLine-Up:\nSimon C Godwin - Guitar.\nDr Colin Baker - Drums.\nSimon Bayliss - Bass Guitar.\nDamo 'Stormrider' Taylor - Vocals.\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Suicide Watch\nAlbum: The Alienation Zone\nGenre: Thrash Metal\nSubGenre: Metal / Thrashcore\nCountry Of Origin: U.K. (Cheltenham)\nYear: 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 192 kbps\nPlaying Time: 00:17:13\nSize: 23.84 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
