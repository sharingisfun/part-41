Freudian dream imagery, amorphous space/time, and absurdist humor combine in this drawn out mating ritual between a confused cyclist and the female he pursues. May be the most inventive fifteen minutes of film anywhere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8eb2f2f314e3adc88d8ce7dfcee745225d454f","amp;dn":"Un+Chien+Andalou+-+1929","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8eb2f2f314e3adc88d8ce7dfcee745225d454f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,142,178,242,243,20,227,173,200,141,140,231,223,206,231,69,34,93,69,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
