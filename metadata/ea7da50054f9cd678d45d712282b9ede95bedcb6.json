These articles constitute a documented history of infidelity and apostasy among professing Christians from the First-century church to today. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“party lineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the cult is defined, and its members identified. There are also discussions of Biblical texts presented by the cult as problems for the believer in order to create unbelief in the heart of the Christian as to what God really said. An excellent primer on the arguments and methods of Biblical apostates.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea7da50054f9cd678d45d712282b9ede95bedcb6","amp;dn":"Alexandrian+Cult+Series+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea7da50054f9cd678d45d712282b9ede95bedcb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,125,165,0,84,249,205,103,141,69,215,18,40,43,158,222,149,190,220,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
