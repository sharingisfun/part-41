When Officer Manhattan's first leader of the crew falls, the Controllers do not provide him with satisfactory answers as to why a robot was salvaged and Commander Falcon was not rescued. Then, when a mysterious robot called Addam Omega shows up as Falcon's replacement, Manhattan really has to wonder what the Controllers are up to. Space opera and intrigue from writer/artists Bill Hughes (Star Wars: Droids).\n\nThanks goes to Talon for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
