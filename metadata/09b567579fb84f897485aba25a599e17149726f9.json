The roms are not zipped. (snes station supports .zip but they have lower compatibility)\n\n2.It Is esr patched (iv'e found many that i could not patch until i modified them a little).\n\n3. There are many rom hacks in this that ive found from various sources including a few excellent fan-made 16 bit remakes of 8-bit classics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09b567579fb84f897485aba25a599e17149726f9","amp;dn":"SNES+for+PS2%2Broms%2CESR%26amp%3BFREEMCBOOT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09b567579fb84f897485aba25a599e17149726f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,181,103,87,159,184,79,137,116,133,171,162,90,89,158,23,20,151,38,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
