Windows 8.1 advances this vision and introduces new manageability, mobility, security, user experience and networking capabilities that will be available later this year Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with the goal of offering customers the best business tablets and versatile modern business PCs driven by the most powerful operating system designed for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modern businesses.\n\nBoot straight to the Desktop:\nWindows 8.1 Update 1 will allow users to boot and resume straight to the classic desktop UI, allowing them to bypass the tiled Modern UI altogether. This will likely be a welcome feature considering that the Modern portion of Windows 8 hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been well received since it debuted back in late 2012.\n\nChanges to the Taskbar:\nWith Windows 8.1 Update 1, you can use both desktop programs and Windows Store apps from the classic desktop UI. Windows Store apps will also work on the desktop UIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Taskbar as well, and a new button on the Taskbar will permit you to access the Windows Store without forcing you to dive into the Modern UI to do so. With Windows 8.1 Update 1, the Taskbar will be accessible while using Modern apps by moving your mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen.\n\nTweaks to the Modern UI Start screen:\nThe Modern UI Start screen will also receive some tweaks, including dedicated Power and Search buttons. The addition of a dedicated power button in the Start Screen will allow users to power their PCs off without having to open the Charms menu, shaving some seconds off the process of shutting down their systems. Newly installed Modern apps will be labeled Ã¢â‚¬Å“New,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and will pull up a drop-down menu when right-clicked, as opposed to the bar on the bottom of the screen.\n\nSkyDrive has been rebranded to OneDrive and is making its debut in Update 1, however very little has changed from the SkyDrive app in Windows 8.1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7259efbed841158492c0ac3dd2f0a158426da21","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+Enterprise+Update+-+MSDN+Untouched","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7259efbed841158492c0ac3dd2f0a158426da21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,37,158,251,237,132,17,88,73,44,10,195,221,47,10,21,132,38,218,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
