Impressive stuff - but not many would have foreseen back then the dizzying pop heights the band would soon achieve; namely a slew of pop savvy tunes (&quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not OK&quot;; &quot;Away From Here&quot;; &quot;40 Days &amp; 40 Nights&quot;), a deal with legendary Stiff imprint (home to Elvis Costello and Ian Dury), and -Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now -Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a triumphant debut album. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Live and Die in These Towns foams with the same youthful vitality that has informed The EnemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singles to date, and showcases their key influences: The Stones, The Jam, Oasis among them. The album starts off with the blistering &quot;Aggro,&quot; which melds heavy bass riffs and drums with an Oasis-style sing-a-long chorus. Tracks like the chugging &quot;Had Enough&quot; boasts an added catchiness with its doo-wop style backing vocals, while the title track could be considered as something of a Jam tribute. The band veer towards the mediocre with &quot;You're Not Alone&quot; and &quot;Technodanceaphobic,&quot; but the stronger material easily overshadows the fillers, making this an accomplished debut. --Danny McKenna\n\n&quot;Aggro&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:25\n&quot;Away From Here&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:02\n&quot;Pressure&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18\n&quot;Had Enough&quot; - 2:39\n&quot;We'll Live and Die in These Towns&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:54\n&quot;You're Not Alone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44\n&quot;It's Not OK&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:35\n&quot;Technodanceaphobic&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:34\n&quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n&quot;This Song&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25\n&quot;Happy Birthday Jane&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad9ab3ff7383de820de8fff30826b61b798683e","amp;dn":"The+Enemy+-+We%27ll+Live+and+Die+in+These+Towns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad9ab3ff7383de820de8fff30826b61b798683e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,217,171,63,247,56,61,232,32,222,143,255,48,130,107,97,183,152,104,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
