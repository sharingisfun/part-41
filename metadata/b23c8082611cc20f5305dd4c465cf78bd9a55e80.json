Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people the 11's. A Britannian who \nwas living in Japan at the time, Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd \ndestroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of\n school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11's \nwho've stolen a military secret and is caught by a member of the Britannian task force \nsent after them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for \ndisobeying orders, while the military secret, a young girl, gives Lelouch the power \nof Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is secretly made the pilot\nof Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare, Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked\nZero to lead the rebellion to destroy Britannia once and for all.\n\nCode Geass R2\nIt's been one year since the failure of the Black Rebellion and the supposed \ndeath of Zero. Britannia has assigned Area 11 a &quot;correctional education&quot; status, \nwhere Elevens are made an example of by brute force, to try to prevent any future \nuprisings and suppress rebellious thoughts. Unsuspecting high school student Lelouch, \noblivious to his rebellious past as Zero, stumbles upon a scheme on his life and the \nlife of a mysterious woman known as C.C., who reveals to him his forgotten purpose and \nhis &quot;true&quot; self. Destroying his assailants and declaring himself Zero once again, Lelouch \nsets out to finish what he started.\n\nGenres\naction, drama, psychological, \nscience fiction, supernatural mecha, military, \n\n\nFormat .......................................................: Matroska\nFile size ......................................................: 98.5 MiB\nDuration ..................................................: 24mn 09s\nOverall bit rate .........................................: 570 Kbps\nWidth .....................................................: 1280 pixels\nHeight ......................................................: 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio ........................................: 16:9\nFrame rate ..............................................: 23.976 fps\nAudio .............................: Eng &amp; Jap AAC @ 48KHz\nSubs .....................................................................:ASS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23c8082611cc20f5305dd4c465cf78bd9a55e80","amp;dn":"Code+Geass+season+1%26amp%3B2+dual+audio+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23c8082611cc20f5305dd4c465cf78bd9a55e80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,60,128,130,97,28,194,15,83,5,221,76,70,92,247,139,217,165,94,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
