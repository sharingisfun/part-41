According to the members, the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name was not intended to mean anything. In 2002, after the first American tour, GyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°a left the band to return to her studies in ReykjavÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­k. Shortly after Gyda left, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½sthildur ValtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½sdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ttir joined for singing duties and Serena Tideman replaced Gyda on cello, for a European tour. Then the ensemble evolved to include ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶f Arnalds, EirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­kur ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafsson and Hildur GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°nadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ttir. In early 2006, KristÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n also left the band, although it was not officially announced until November 23.[1]\nDespite the departure of some of its members mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºm has remained together as a collective of musicians. Their fourth album recorded during 2006 was released on 24 September 2007, entitled Go Go Smear the Poison Ivy. The album was preceded by a single titled They Made Frogs Smoke ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Til They Exploded on 27 August 2007. The band has toured extensively in 2007 and 2008.\n\n\n[2000] Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK\n\n   1. &quot;I'm 9 Today&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n   2. &quot;Smell Memory&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:23\n   3. &quot;There Is a Number of Small Things&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:32\n   4. &quot;Random Summer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n   5. &quot;Asleep on a Train&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:17\n   6. &quot;Awake on a Train&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:23\n   7. &quot;The Ballad of the Broken Birdie Records&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n   8. &quot;The Ballad of the Broken String&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n   9. &quot;Sunday Night Just Keeps on Rolling&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:10\n  10. &quot;Slow Bicycle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:47\n\n[2002] Finally We Are No One\n\n   1. &quot;Sleep/Swim&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:50\n   2. &quot;Green Grass of Tunnel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n   3. &quot;We Have a Map of the Piano&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19\n   4. &quot;Don't Be Afraid, You Have Just Got Your Eyes Closed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:43\n   5. &quot;Behind Two Hills,,,,A Swimmingpool&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:08\n   6. &quot;K/Half Noise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:41\n   7. &quot;Now There's That Fear Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n   8. &quot;Faraway Swimmingpool&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n   9. &quot;I Can't Feel My Hand Any More, It's Alright, Sleep Still&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:40\n  10. &quot;Finally We Are No One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n  11. &quot;The Land Between Solar Systems&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:58\n\n[2004] Summer Make Good\n\n   1. &quot;HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº Hviss - A Ship&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:27\n   2. &quot;Weeping Rock, Rock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:18\n   3. &quot;Nightly Cares&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n   4. &quot;The Ghosts You Draw on My Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n   5. &quot;Stir&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n   6. &quot;Sing Me Out the Window&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n   7. &quot;The Island of Children's Children&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n   8. &quot;Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:28\n   9. &quot;Oh, How the Boat Drifts&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n  10. &quot;Small Deaths Are the Saddest&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:30\n  11. &quot;Will the Summer Make Good for All of Our Sins?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n  12. &quot;Abandoned Ship Bells&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n\n[2007] Go Go Smear The Poison Ivy\n\n   1. &quot;Blessed Brambles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:00\n   2. &quot;A Little Bit, Sometimes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n   3. &quot;They Made Frogs Smoke 'Til They Exploded&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n   4. &quot;These Eyes Are Berries&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n   5. &quot;Moon Pulls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n   6. &quot;Marmalade Fires&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n   7. &quot;Rhubarbidoo&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n   8. &quot;Dancing Behind My Eyelids&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n   9. &quot;Schoolsong Misfortune&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:39\n  10. &quot;I Was Her Horse&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:08\n  11. &quot;Guilty Rocks&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n  12. &quot;Winter (What We Never Were After All)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed2bf5ab3f37adb6b1ab48b99c3b0d3d79b350b4","amp;dn":"M%C3%83%C2%BAm+discography+%28Icelandic+electronica+band%29+MP3+192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed2bf5ab3f37adb6b1ab48b99c3b0d3d79b350b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,43,245,171,63,55,173,182,177,171,72,185,156,59,13,61,121,179,80,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
