Following a couple of one-off reunions in 1985 and 1992, the original \nSabbath line-up of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward reformed, playing sporadic \ndates until Dio replaced Ozzy a second time, reforming the Heaven and Hell lineup to tour following \nthe release of the compilation album The Dio Years.\n\nThis 2-CD live album was put together from the first two shows after the reunion, at the Birmingham \nNEC. Along with live versions of tracks such as &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;N.I.B.&quot;, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot; \nit also features two new studio tracks - &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; and &quot;Psycho Man&quot;. This was the only new \nmaterial to have been officially released by Black Sabbath post-reunion until three new tracks \nappeared on the post-Ozzy compilation Black Sabbath: The Dio Years in 2007. The two new tracks on \nReunion were also released on a single CD in the USA.\n\n\n   1. Black Sabbath - War Pigs [Live]                         [08:27]\n   2.
