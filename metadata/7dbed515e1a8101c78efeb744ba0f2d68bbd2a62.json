The central conclusion is that the logic of waging war and of strategic thinking is as universal and timeless as human nature itself.\n\nThis third revised and expanded edition contains five new chapters. One of these concerns Clausewitz' insights into the problem of war termination. Another is dedicated to the importance of correctly identifying the nature of war. The author has also added a chapter on Corbett's naval strategy, the relation of his work to the spirit of that of Sun Tzu, and in particular the issue of limited war and war by limited contingency.&quot;\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dbed515e1a8101c78efeb744ba0f2d68bbd2a62","amp;dn":"Masters+of+War%3A+Classical+Strategic+Thought","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dbed515e1a8101c78efeb744ba0f2d68bbd2a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,190,213,21,225,168,16,28,120,239,235,116,75,160,242,214,139,189,42,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
