Were they Ã¢â‚¬Å“just following ordersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as some later declared? Or, did they break under the pressure of a vicious war in which the line between enemy soldier and civilian had been intentionally blurred? AMERICAN EXPERIENCE focuses on the 1968 My Lai massacre, its subsequent cover-up, and the heroic efforts of the soldiers who broke ranks to try to halt the atrocities, and then bring them to light.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0466c682e875986b1907b5e7e1c47f9c1bb1558c","amp;dn":"American+Experience+%28PBS%29+My+Lai+-++Massacre+in+Vietnam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0466c682e875986b1907b5e7e1c47f9c1bb1558c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,102,198,130,232,117,152,107,25,7,181,231,225,196,127,156,27,177,85,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
