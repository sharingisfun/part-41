I also liked Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and RocknRolla.  And while I did like Snatch, I probably preferred it the least of the four.  I haven't even seen Swept Away, I've heard it's horrible though.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c9581c8f869aa8d161f701bc7aa5b954676cf2","amp;dn":"Guy+Richie+Movies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c9581c8f869aa8d161f701bc7aa5b954676cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,201,88,28,143,134,154,168,209,97,247,1,188,122,165,185,84,103,108,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
