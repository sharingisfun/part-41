She wants you to become aware. Her mission on her internationally syndicated radio program, The Aware ShowÃ¢â‚¬â€and now in her first bookÃ¢â‚¬â€is to inspire positive growth in all areas of life and bring conscious conversations into everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s living room.\nLisaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own story is remarkable. Several years ago, she suffered a traumatic brain injury during a freak biking accident that rendered her unable to speak or rely on her short-term memory. She not only used cutting-edge EEG techniques to heal, but also set out to live a different life than the one she was leading in her pre-accident days. Lisa used this experience as a wake-up call and decided to transform in every way possible, including marrying her true love and giving birth to their daughter.\n\nToday, the woman who couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even say a few words is a radio and Internet sensation with a massively growing audience and multimedia platform. Now she brings the lessons she has learned from countless interviews with inspirational, spiritual, and new-thought leaders to the pages of this book. She discusses how sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s applied them to her own life, and explains how you can, too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76181eed98a67fe5f4754a27d5e56698f2e586fb","amp;dn":"Becoming+Aware%3A+How+to+Repattern+Your+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76181eed98a67fe5f4754a27d5e56698f2e586fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,24,30,237,152,166,127,229,244,117,74,39,213,229,102,152,242,229,134,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
