It contains:\n\n\nDoom 64\nDoom (Ultimate of course)\nDoom 2\nFinal Doom TNT Evilution\nFinal Doom Plutonia Experiment\nHeretic\nHexen\nStrife - Quest for the Sigil (with voices and Legacy of Strife fanmod)\nHACX (cancelled ID game. Never saw daylight. Fanmade recreation here)\n\nPlus, the following unofficial expansions for Doom:\n\nMemento Mori \nHell Revealed \nHell Revealed 2 \nRequiem \nThe Darkening \nAlien Vendetta\nDoom Odyssey\nDark 7\n\n\nExcluding Doom 64, all Doom games are running with Hi-Res textures packs (not ugly 3d models), Hi-quality MP3 music (instead of old MIDI music) AND with Brutal Mod by Sergeant_Mark_IV. This mod brings ultra stylish gore, with tons of well-made new moves, fatalities (!) and animations. \n\nNo bugs with mods. No shitty one level wads or crappy wad selection and call it a Collection. I've built an launcher on C# to avoid headaches with configurations, settings, mods and bla bla. Just run the launcher and hit a button to start the damn thing :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4fdafc3a8c88326a493d0ba080d6935ef35934c","amp;dn":"Best+ID+Collectors+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4fdafc3a8c88326a493d0ba080d6935ef35934c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,253,175,195,168,200,131,38,164,147,208,186,8,13,105,53,239,53,147,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
