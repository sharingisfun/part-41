Not just straight to video, but shot on video with video effects that 80s Canadian public access TV would be ashamed of, it features medieval sets that look like they were borrowed from a grade school pantomime, extras clearly recruited from a renaissance fair purely for their ability to provide their own costumes, and two brothers, Michael and Ulric, who are just about the most unlikeable heroes ever put to video.\n\nPrincess Luna (or Princess Moon, or Princess Lina -- she's called all three) is kidnapped by the dark lord Saletin... well, you pretty much know this part. To cut to the chase, our heroes are coshed and abducted from the nearest brothel where they were eyeing topless wenches, and tasked to travel to present day (in 1989) Los Angeles where Lord Saletin has hidden Luna in a cunning move to save on locations. Once they get there, they meander around aimlessly searching for exposition and the main villain, who spends the entire movie taunting them from an undisclosed location. In a profoundly adolescent touch, they have been told that the princess has a special birthmark on her left breast, so they rip the top off virtually every woman they meet to see if she is the princess they seek. You think I'm making this up. I'm not.\n\nWhenever the plot really drags, our heroes are attacked at random by police, street punks, zombie bikers, and at one point concerned citizens who are outraged that our heroes have just sexually assaulted a woman in the street. It has already been established that the heroes' magic can teleport them out of any jam, yet they insist on duking it out in sequence after sequence of badly choreographed fights.\n\nAfter one such fight, they team up with a 20th century D&amp;D fanboy who has the vital special skill of being able to drive them to the villain's hidden lair. The third co-star has a distinct quality of &quot;cousin James is prepared to put up $5,000 for financing, but he wants a leading role&quot; about him. In one fight, instead of helping him, our heroes nobly start betting about when he'll bite it.\n\nBoring, clichÃƒÂ©d, with sub-adolescent sexual &quot;humour&quot;, and paced so poorly it seems like the toughest obstacle the protagonists face is doing the paperwork to get into the local library's convenient vault of eldritch magic tomes, &quot;Lords of Magick&quot; is an abortion of a movie, utterly without redeeming merit. Do not watch it for the zombies or the topless wenches. In no way do they make up for the sheer tedium and humiliating embarrassment of enduring this turkey. You can actually see the expression play over Ruth Zakarian's face as she thinks 'I'm so going to fire my agent.'&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:463848495484aa68c9b4806ee5c4c8fefc02b5b3","amp;dn":"The+Lords+of+Magick+%5BVHSRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"463848495484aa68c9b4806ee5c4c8fefc02b5b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,56,72,73,84,132,170,104,201,180,128,110,229,196,200,254,252,2,181,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
