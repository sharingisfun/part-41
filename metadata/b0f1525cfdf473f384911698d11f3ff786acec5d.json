And there's help direct from outer space as Britain's first astronaut on the International Space Station, Tim Peake, dials in.\r\n\r\n2. Life in Orbit\r\nKevin explores life in orbit on board the Station. As Tim settles in to his new home he sends special reports about what it takes to live and work in space. Four hundred kilometres above the Earth, hurtling at a speed of 17,500mph, astronauts' bones and muscles waste away, the oxygen they breathe is artificially made, and they face constant threats from micrometeorites, radiation and extreme temperatures. If a medical emergency strikes, Tim is a very long way from home. In its 15-year lifetime, the International Space Station has never had a major accident. With a British astronaut in orbit, gravity-defying experiments and guest astronauts in the lecture theatre, Dr Fong shows us how to survive life in orbit.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3300Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.47 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.41 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f1525cfdf473f384911698d11f3ff786acec5d","amp;dn":"How.to.Survive.in.Space.2of3.Life.in.Orbit.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f1525cfdf473f384911698d11f3ff786acec5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,241,82,92,253,244,115,243,132,145,22,152,209,31,63,247,134,172,236,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
