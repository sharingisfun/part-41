Even though she followed their tour bus up a slick mountain pass during a blizzard, she never expected to spend an entire snowy night with two generous rock stars who love to share their gifts. Trapped on a tour bus with her best friend, a rock band, and the bus driver, what can these naughty ladies possibly do to keep warm? Perhaps a better question is what won't they do?\n\nBook 1: Try Me (One Night With Sole Regret #1) by Olivia Cunning (June 2012)\n\nFor the five sexy rock gods of Sole Regret, finding love is easy, keeping it is hard.\n\nMelanie has no desire to meet the members of the rock band, Sole Regret, but her groupie of a best friend gets them both backstage and then rushes off with the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lead singer. Left alone at an after party with a bunch of scary tattooed and pierced metal-heads, sheltered Melanie is relieved when the only normal-looking guy in the room insists on keeping her company.\n\nBy the time Melanie discovers that Gabe is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drummer and not as normal as she assumed, she has already made a complete fool of herself. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but be interested in him, not as a rock star, but as the sexiest man sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever encountered. Strangely attracted to his hidden tattoos and body piercing, she wonders what it would be like to spend a night with a bad boy.\n\nGabe is more than willing to show sweet Melanie thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to him than meets the eye. All she has to do is try him. Will they only share a single night of passion? Or will their hearts entangle as quickly as their bodies?\n\nBook 2: Tempt Me (One Night With Sole Regret #2) by Olivia Cunning (September 2012)\n\nFor the five sexy rock gods of Sole Regret, finding love is easy, keeping it is hard.\n\nOne more nightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFor almost a year, Madison has been AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hook-up every time his band, Sole Regret, tours through Dallas.

She needs a commitment and knows that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fit into AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rock-star lifestyle.
