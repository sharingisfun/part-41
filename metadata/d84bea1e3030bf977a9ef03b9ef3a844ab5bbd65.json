Professor Alex Bradford, a stage personality, pianist, and singer who was the music minister at Newark's Abyssinian Baptist Church in the 1960s, alters that approach on this live recording, to thrilling effect. The musicians serve as catalysts, not accompanistsÃ¢â‚¬â€their crisp, unified attack sets the tone for the soloists. It galvanizes the choir. Runs the show.\n\nThe three mortals who make up this screaming locomotive of a rhythm section jolt the 120 Abyssinian voices out of the Sunday-services routine into near-ecstatic communication they sustain from the beginning of this disc to the end. The songs are mostly Bradford originals, expressions of faith and praise that emulate the works of legendary gospel composer Thomas A. Dorsey (see p. 233). Several of them belong alongside Dorsey's best, including &quot;Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody,&quot; which is resolute from the opening line, and the 6/8 blues &quot;He Is Such an Understanding God.&quot; Loaded with crackling call-and-response exchanges and outbreaks of intricately contrapuntal soul-clapping jubilation, these feature hot solo singing from Calvin White and Margaret Simpson, but they're never really solo vehicles. The choir is right there, contributing asides and shouts, blasting past doubt and despair with a contagious energy most often associated with the early days of rock and roll.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d84bea1e3030bf977a9ef03b9ef3a844ab5bbd65","amp;dn":"The+Greater+Abyssinian+Baptist+Choir+Of+Newark%2C+N.J.+-+Shakin%27+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d84bea1e3030bf977a9ef03b9ef3a844ab5bbd65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,75,234,30,48,48,191,151,122,158,240,59,158,243,168,68,171,91,189,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
