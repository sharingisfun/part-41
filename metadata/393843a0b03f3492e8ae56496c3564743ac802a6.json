I shouldn't be alone with him. But I can't help that he's irresistible. I let the door silently close at my back. He stared at me, and a taut quiet stretched between us. &quot;I like hearing you play,&quot; I said, moving toward him. He turned, in sync with my slow approach. He looked up at me but didn't say anything. I rested my clammy hand on the cold, slick body of the baby grand. &quot;May I?&quot; The muscles in his throat shifted, then he swallowed. &quot;Eden.&quot; My knees weakened, like a soft tickling kiss had just been blown against the backs of them. &quot;Is it okay?&quot; I asked. His gaze held mine like two hands joined. He understood what I was really asking. &quot;Let me stay,&quot; I said. &quot;Please.&quot; &quot;You're going to get me in trouble,&quot; he said.\n\n\n\nIs this torrent dead?
