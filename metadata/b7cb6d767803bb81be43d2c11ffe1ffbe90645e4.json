The band scored a UK No.6 hit with &quot;Natural Sinner&quot; in 1970 and recorded one album before disbanding a year later.\n\n\nFairweather-Low went on to a successful solo career in the 1970s, notably with the top ten hit &quot;Wide Eyed and Legless&quot; (1975); he became a regular player with Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Roger Waters. He also worked with The Strawbs and the Bee Gees.\n\n\nAmen Corner's Decca back catalogue has been reissued as part of 'The Collection' series; and their Immediate work, as a double CD, including their singles, live album and material recorded for an unreleased studio album, under the title &quot;If Paradise Was Half as Nice: The Immediate Anthology&quot;.\n\nAmen Corner:\n*Andy Fairweather Low: Vocals\n*Neil Jones: Guitar\n*Allan Jones: Saxophone\n*Blue Weaver: Keyboards\n*Mike Smith: Tenor Saxophone\n*Clive Taylor: Bass\n*Dennis Byron: Drums\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7cb6d767803bb81be43d2c11ffe1ffbe90645e4","amp;dn":"Amen+corner...If+Paradise+Was+Half+as+Nice%3B+The+Immediate+Anthol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7cb6d767803bb81be43d2c11ffe1ffbe90645e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,203,109,118,120,3,187,129,190,67,210,193,31,254,31,251,233,6,69,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
