This small venue allows them the freedom to do some &quot;unplugged&quot; and re-arranged versions of some of their popular hits. There's also some interaction from the band explaining some of the songs, arrangements, and stories and gives a look inside the band itself.  \n\nWe're not too particularly fond of the band ourselves but, a nice lady friend of ours made this request so, we upped it for her and all those romantics in PB land! \n \nThis 41 minute (approx) mini-concert includes such hits as &quot;3 A.M.&quot;, &quot;A Different Side of Me&quot;, &quot;Slow Dancin'&quot;, &quot;Crutch&quot;, &quot;Real World&quot;, and more.\n\n\n\nformat: xvid, mp3\nResolution: 624 x 352 HD WS\nFrame Rate: 29fps\nRun Time: 00:41:25\n\n\nRemember.....PLEASE SEED!!\n\n...and, as always...ENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:432f581660c2291d1a67ce069f23632e28aa7b96","amp;dn":"Matchbox+Twenty+%2ALIVE%2A+-+SoundStage+Presentation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"432f581660c2291d1a67ce069f23632e28aa7b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,47,88,22,96,194,41,29,26,103,206,6,159,35,99,46,40,170,123,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
