Not all apps are compatible, so please test during the trial period.\r\n\r\nFor best compatibility we recommend using BluezIME-compatible controllers when physical controller is needed. Some compatibility issues can be solved with the help of root features, please contact us when having problem.\r\n\r\nHow to call up GameKeyboard\r\n\r\n- enable &quot;Settings-&gt;Use HotKey&quot; then use [Vol. Up]/[Mouse Middle] as hotkey\r\n- enable &quot;Settings-&gt;Use Hotspot&quot; then tap on hotspot screen corner\r\n\r\nLimitation of Standalone Mode\r\n\r\nAt the moment Qwerty is not supported and unwanted key/button input may not be filtered.
