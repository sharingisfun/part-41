It was released as the second single from their debut album Franz Ferdinand in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2004 and in the United States on 9 February, both through Domino Records. It was released on CD, 7&quot; vinyl, and as a DVD single with the video promo and a short interview with the band.  The single reached number three in the UK Singles Chart. In the U.S., it reached number three on Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was a number-seven hit on the Canadian Singles Chart, and also reached #1 on the UK Indie Chart. The song was voted the best single of 2004 by the Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop poll, and number one on Australian youth radio network Triple J's Hottest 100 of the same year.[2] In July 2009, it was voted number 100 in Triple J's Hottest 100 of all time.  In November 2004, the single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America\n\nVideo - The promotional video for the song was directed by Jonas Odell. It includes the band in the midst of a Dadaist and somewhat Pythonesque (surreal Terry Gilliam style) animation involving quirky vintage figures and machinery. The video is a blend of the live action band superimposed into a 3D environment with animated 2D elements.  Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos explained the many and varied influences behind the '30s-style promo for second single &quot;Take Me Out&quot;:  &quot;It's kind of two dimensional in a three dimensional style if that makes any sense. It's a montage of images; ourselves, pictures and things taken from other places and put together in a strange, abstract way. That's what gives the video that strange, jerky style.  &quot;The idea came out of stuff we'd been talking about as a band - we all like the photo montage style that you get from the dada artists who would literally cut up photographs and make new images with the pieces. You get this strange, disjointed look where limbs and heads aren't the same proportions. So you get a very jarring effect.  &quot;We wanted to combine that with other ideas, like those old films from the 1930s that were directed by Busby Berkely; he would have these geometric shapes formed by dancers, chorus girls all making these fantastic shapes in water. But we wanted to take it further; he'd use the human shape to make these abstract shapes and we wanted to take it further by using limbs and arms and repeat them to make the human form even less human. So we have a lot of that in the video too, a lot of legs kicking in the air and arms moving to create that same sort of effect.&quot;  &quot;Another sort of imagery that we liked was the kind you'd get in Russian film and propaganda posters, again from the 1930s, which had a kind of constructivist approach; everything was very flat and very geometric and you tended to have limited colours and very blocky styles. We wanted to combine those three styles, so there're a lot of concentric circles, geometric shapes and blocks moving around in time to the music.  &quot;We were very lucky when we made the video 'cos we had all these ideas but we didn't know if it was possible to make a video like that or if it would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds or something but fortunately we met a guy called Jonas Odell. Laurence from Domino knew him and thought he'd be interested in our ideas so we got chatting and he immediately got all the reference points and really liked them. We liked the other videos he'd done, we really liked his style and he said he'd love to give it a go. So he sent us a clip of how he imagined the video looking and we just looked at it and thought 'Wow this is fantastic, the guy's really tuned in'. It was really good fun, we sent lots of e-mails to and fro going through our ideas and how we'd follow them through. I think he did an amazing job, we were really impressed.  &quot;Basically it's a pop video and it should entertain you, but not just once - there're certain things you stare at in life that is just fascinating to look at like a fish tank or an open fire, they're actually quite simple things but there's something fascinating about them. And I think pop videos should be like that too. There should be something there that just makes you want to come back and look at it.&quot;.\n\n\nOriginal DVD Rip..................: Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader................: Yes - only1joe\nUpload Speed.......................: 500kB/s\nMusic Genre.........................: Rock\n\nYou can view the music video using VLC Player http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or choose your own player.\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n(*_*) Special thanks to Sketch6995 over at 1337x for letting me use his seed box for initial seeding after upload.\n\nMusic Video Media Info\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID.....................: 209026205462580991494870018339839459534 (0x9D40FB9A7F7CC398063D84AC928CC0CE)\nComplete name............: Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out 2004.mkv\nFormat..........................: Matroska\nFormat version.............: Version 2\nFile size.........................: 171 MiB\nDuration........................: 3mn 59s\nOverall bit rate mode....: Variable\nOverall bit rate..............: 5 997 Kbps\nEncoded date.................: UTC 2013-10-04 22:13:33\nWriting application.......: MakeMKV v1.8.5 win(x86-release)\nWriting library...............: libmakemkv v1.8.5 (1.2.0/1.1.0) win(x86-release)\n\nVideo\nID................................................: 1\nFormat........................................: MPEG Video\nFormat version............................: Version 2\nFormat profile.............................: Main@Main\nFormat settings, BVOP...............: No\nFormat settings, Matrix.............: Custom\nCodec ID....................................: V_MPEG2\nCodec ID/Info...........................: MPEG 1 or 2 Video\nDuration....................................: 3mn 59s\nBit rate mode............................: Variable\nBit rate......................................: 5 686 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate......................: 9 800 Kbps\nWidth........................................: 720 pixels\nHeight.......................................: 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio...................: 4:3\nFrame rate mode.......................: Constant\nFrame rate.................................: 25.000 fps\nStandard....................................: PAL\nColor space................................: YUV\nChroma subsampling.................: 4:2:0\nBit depth....................................: 8 bits\nScan type...................................: Interlaced\nScan order.................................: Top Field First\nCompression mode....................: Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) ..................: 0.548\nTime code of first frame............: 11:19:13:08\nTime code source.......................: Group of pictures header\nStream size................................: 162 MiB (95%)\nLanguage...................................: English\nDefault.......................................: No\nForced........................................: No\n\nVideo\nID...............................................: 2\nFormat........................................: AC-3\nFormat/Info...............................: Audio Coding 3\nMode extension...........................: CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness.....: Big\nCodec ID.....................................: A_AC3\nDuration.....................................: 3mn 59s\nBit rate mode.............................: Constant\nBit rate.......................................: 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) ................................: 2 channels\nChannel positions......................: Front: L R\nSampling rate............................: 48.0 KHz\nBit depth....................................: 16 bits\nCompression mode.....................: Lossy\nStream size................................: 5.48 MiB (3%)\nTitle............................................: 2/0\nLanguage...................................: English\nDefault.......................................: Yes\nForced........................................: No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75104c8f45eab66079628ac4a161ca40ea1998e","amp;dn":"Franz+Ferdinand+-+Take+Me+Out+2004+only1joe+mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75104c8f45eab66079628ac4a161ca40ea1998e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,81,4,200,244,94,171,102,7,150,40,172,74,22,28,164,14,161,153,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
