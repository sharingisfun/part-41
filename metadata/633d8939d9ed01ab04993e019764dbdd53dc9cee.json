Brown III,Kenneth Choi,Carrie Coon,Spencer Grammer,Holly Curran\n\n.: Plot :.\nIn the gritty world of the NYPD, no one's tougher than Detective Robert Ironside. He's a fearless cop who won't stop until the guilty are brought to justice. He and his trusted, handpicked team of specialists will do whatever it takes to solve New York's most difficult and notorious crimes - even if it means breaking the rules.\n\nTough, sexy and acerbic, Ironside's never been afraid to call it like he sees it. As a detective, his instincts are second to none, and those around him have to stay on their toes if they want to keep up... because when his spine was shattered by a bullet two years ago, Ironside swore he'd never let a damn wheelchair slow him down.\n\nJustice. Nothing gets in his way. Blair Underwood stars in a bold new drama about a different kind of cop. One-hour drama.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633d8939d9ed01ab04993e019764dbdd53dc9cee","amp;dn":"Ironside.2013.S01E01.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633d8939d9ed01ab04993e019764dbdd53dc9cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,61,137,57,217,237,1,171,4,153,62,1,151,100,219,221,83,220,156,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
