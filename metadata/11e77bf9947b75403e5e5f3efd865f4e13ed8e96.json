WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY\r\nCOEXISTENCE?\r\nANSWER: The word coexistence has a very bad political connotation.\r\nCoexistence simply means that the two parties remain hostile, that there is no\r\nother way for reconciliation, for meeting, for merging. Coexistence is the least\r\nthat can be done.\r\nFor example, the Soviet Union and America are in coexistence. \r\nQ: YOU HAVE SAID YOU HAVE NEVER PAID ANY TAXES BECAUSE YOUR\r\nWORK IS CONCERNED WITH OUTCOME, NOT WITH INCOME. WHAT DO\r\nYOU MEAN BY THIS OUTCOME?\r\nA: Just the opposite of income.\r\nQ: MANY TIMES YOU HAVE STRESSED THAT YOU ARE NOT A\r\nRAJNEESHEE, OFTEN POINTING OUT THAT ONE CAN TELL BY YOUR\r\nCLOTHES. WHY DO YOU INSIST ON THE DISTINCTION? IS THERE A\r\nGREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PEOPLE WHO CALL\r\nTHEMSELVES RAJNEESHEES? OR IS IT JUST A MATTER OF CLOTHES?\r\nA: It is just a matter of clothes.\r\nQ: BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOUR HOST LOOKS AFTER YOU -- YOUR\r\nBEAUTIFUL CLOTHES, THE JEWELERY, THE CARS -- DO SOME OF YOUR\r\nSANNYASINS PUT YOU ON A PEDESTAL AND FEEL THAT YOU ARE\r\nHIGHER THAN THEM? HOW CAN THEY AVOID THIS TRAP WHILE STILL\r\nGIVING YOU ALL THE LOVE AND CARE THAT THEY DO?\r\nA: Nobody is putting me on any higher pedestal. There is no need to avoid it\r\nbecause I am alert enough not to sit on any higher pedestal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11e77bf9947b75403e5e5f3efd865f4e13ed8e96","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament+Vol-2+%2318.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11e77bf9947b75403e5e5f3efd865f4e13ed8e96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,231,123,249,148,123,117,64,62,94,95,62,253,134,95,78,19,237,142,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
