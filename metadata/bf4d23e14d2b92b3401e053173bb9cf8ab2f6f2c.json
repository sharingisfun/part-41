Her announcement, in March, of the Hammersmith gigs left even David BowieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gifted coup in the shade, creating a simmering summer of speculation. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprising, then, that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken the media so long to create the inevitable previews and retrospectives. This BBC Four feature did a bit of both, though it ended with a sense that BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation survived the hour despite, rather than because of, the programmeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organisation.
