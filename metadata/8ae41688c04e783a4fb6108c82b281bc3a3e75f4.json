However, he also had a dancehall Rockers edge that was best exemplified by the album Bunny Wailer Sings the Wailers in which he reinterprets some of the Wailers material as a solo Roots singer backed by a solid Sly &amp; Robbie based Roots reggae grouping. The album was produced by Bunny Wailer, recorded at Harry J studies. These tracks are re-worked classic Wailers tracks.\n\nThis is a needledrop copied from a UK 1st edition using:\n\nLinn LP12, Lingo, Ekos and Dynavector XX2 moving coil cartridge, via a  Naim 62 pre-amp into Pioneer PDR-609 CDR, using TDK audio CDR.\n\nArt work from the original lp included.\n\nPlease seed\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ae41688c04e783a4fb6108c82b281bc3a3e75f4","amp;dn":"Bunny+Wailer+Sings+The+Wailers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ae41688c04e783a4fb6108c82b281bc3a3e75f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,228,22,136,192,78,120,58,79,182,16,140,130,178,129,188,58,62,117,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
