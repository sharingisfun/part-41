He did manage two classics, Spaces, and this one, The Restful Mind. It is no small coincidence that the better\nthe personnel he surrounded himself with, the better he played. On Spaces, the presence of John McLaughlin and Chick Corea raised his playing to another level. Here, with the backing of the group Oregon (with the\nexception of Paul McCandless), who were also signed to Vanguard at this time), bring out a more reflective and relaxed Coryell. His tendency to fall back on his chops was always a weak spot in his playing, but it is\nthankfully absent here. Both of the &quot;Improvisation&quot; pieces are highlights in Coryell's career, which along with the other beaufitul selections, make this one of his best, and certainly most overlooked, recordings. \n\nTracks:\n1.
