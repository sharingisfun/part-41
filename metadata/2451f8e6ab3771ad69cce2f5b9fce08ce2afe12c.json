Nowadays, the field of functional equations is an ever-growing branch of mathematics with far-reaching applications; it is increasingly used to investigate problems in mathematical analysis, combinatorics, biology, information theory, statistics, physics, the behavioral sciences, and engineering.\n\nThis self-contained monograph explores all aspects of functional equations and their applications to related topics, such as differential equations, integral equations, the Laplace transformation, the calculus of finite differences, and many other basic tools in analysis. Each chapter examines a particular family of equations and gives an in-depth study of its applications as well as examples and exercises to support the material.\n\nThe book is intended as a reference tool for any student, professional (researcher), or mathematician studying in a field where functional equations can be applied. It can also be used as a primary text in a classroom setting or for self-study. Finally, it could be an inspiring entrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e into an active area of mathematical exploration for engineers and other scientists who would benefit from this careful, rigorous exposition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2451f8e6ab3771ad69cce2f5b9fce08ce2afe12c","amp;dn":"Functional+Equations+and+Inequalities+with+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2451f8e6ab3771ad69cce2f5b9fce08ce2afe12c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,81,248,230,171,55,113,173,105,204,226,245,185,252,224,140,226,175,225,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
