The group is formed by singer Kaiti Kink and two professional game and film composers Tapani Siirtola and Joonas Naskali.\n\n1.  Let Me Into Your Mind 04:47\t\n2.

The Journey 09:26 \n\nInspired by their collaboration and amazing feedback from the Iron Sky fans, Kaiti Kink Ensemble decided to develop their music into a full scale album release. During 2011 Naskali and Siirtola started composing, recording and producing the album in their recording studio in Tampere and partially in an old countryside mansion, where cows were grazing on the backyard. During that year it became clear that the band didn't want to limit themselves into a specific predetermined genre. Instead the group wanted to fully explore different emotions and soundscapes in their first big release. As a result, their debut album Under the Iron Sky is nothing less than an outstanding collection of dynamic and fresh-sounding tracks.\n\nreleased 06 April 2012\nSinger: Kaiti Kink\nComposers: Tapani Siirtola &amp; Joonas Naskali\nViolin (1,3,4,5,7): Anri TuohimÃƒÂ¤ki\nCello &amp; Double Bass (1,3,7): Esa Korja\nTrumpets (2): Mikko Routimo, Jouni Parkkonen\nSaxophone (9): Aki Ekqvist\nDrums (2): Vilho Rajala\nDrums (3): Juha Alaste\nBass (5): Mikko Soukkala\n\nAlbum art: Hanna-Kaisa HuhtamÃƒÂ¤ki\n\nAlbum produced and released by Sound Reel Finland\nMastered by Chartmakers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea6b9c58795e9288993c58b11b1597a248ac579b","amp;dn":"Kaiti+Kink+Ensemble+-+Under+the+Iron+Sky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea6b9c58795e9288993c58b11b1597a248ac579b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,107,156,88,121,94,146,136,153,60,88,177,27,21,151,162,72,172,87,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
