Virmati, a young woman born in Amritsar into an austere and high-minded household, falls in love with a neighbour, the Professor--a man who is already married. That the Professor eventually marries Virmati, installs her in his home (alongside his furious first wife) and helps her towards further studies in Lahore, is small consolation to her scandalised family. Or even to Virmati, who finds that the battle for her own independence has created irrevocable lines of partition and pain around her.[/color][/i]\n \n[b][i][color=darkviolet]THE IMMIGRANT[/color][/i][/b]\n \n[i][color=green]Nina, at thirty, sees herself as increasingly off the shelf. But then unexpectedly, a proposal arrives. Ananda is a dentist in Halifax, Canada. The two marry and she leaves her home and her country to build a new life with him. But there is always more to marriage than courtship. And as Nina discovers truths about her husband Ã¢â‚¬â€œ both sexual and emotional Ã¢â‚¬â€œ her fragile new life in Canada begins to unravel. The Immigrant is another mesmerizing saga about the complexities of arranged marriage and NRI life from this most beloved of novelists.[/color][/i]\n\n \n[b][i][color=red]CUSTODY[/color][/i][/b]\n \n[i][color=green]Raman is a fast rising marketing executive at a global drinks company; Shagun is his extraordinarily beautiful wife. With his glittering future, her vivid beauty, and their two adorable childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€eight year old Arjun who looks just like her and two year old Roohi who looks just like himÃ¢â‚¬â€the pair appear to have everything. Then Shagun meets RamanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dynamic new boss Ashok and everything changes. Once lovers and companions, husband and wife become enemies locked in an ugly legal battle over their two children. Caught in their midst is the childless Ishita who is in love with the idea of motherhood. Custody is the riveting story of how family-love can disintegrate into an obsession to possess children, body and soul, as well as a chilling critique of the Indian judicial system. Told with nuance, sympathy, and clear-sightedness, it confirms Manju KapurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation as the great chronicler of the modern Indian family.[/color][/i]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539144c7397ca074b51b48f98acfbc724b01404f","amp;dn":"Diffcult+Daughters%2C+The+Immigrant+%26amp%3B+Custody+By+Manju+Kapur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539144c7397ca074b51b48f98acfbc724b01404f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,145,68,199,57,124,160,116,181,27,72,249,138,207,188,114,75,1,64,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
