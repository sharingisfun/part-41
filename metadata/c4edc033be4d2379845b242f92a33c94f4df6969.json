Gone temporarily are those massed percussion Black Sheep workouts of recent years, replaced across PSYCHEDELIC REVOLUTIONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two half-hour-long CDs by eleven epic examples of the ArchdrudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most scrupulously-written balladry. Listen to those fucking lyrics! And as CD1 and CD2 are dedicated to CopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two most politically intense heroes and heroines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Che Guevara and Leila Khaled Ã¢â‚¬â€œ listeners will be right to expect the always fiery intensity of the ArchdrudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance. Expect tales of insurrection, tales of building new cultural traditions and tales of sexism, racism and even species-ism. Yes, both intellectually and sonically, this is a record to engage deeply with the listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unconscious. And with its massed banks of Mellotron 400, wah-acoustic guitars, oboe and brass, this new Cope album is one to Send You Under again and again.\n\nPSYCHEDELIC REVOLUTION features chanteuse Lucy Brownhills taking lead vocals on the title track, and arrives with a 16-page booklet chock full of new political art and poems from the Archdrude. Dig PSYCHEDELIC REVOLUTION and look out for its sibling REVOLUTIONARY SUICIDE later this year.
