Anne's husband Leo (Andy Serkis) has been framed by deranged police chief Mannix Bone (Liam Cunningham), who often beats up various townsfolk whenever the psychopathic inspiration hits him. Bone has also forced Flick to cut him in on the whisky-running profits. Released from jail, Leo plots revenge, and violence erupts.\n\nI know this isn't the best quality, but I just thought some people would enjoy having this in English with no Dutch subtitles. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b556604972671fc2368430cf1c0298fdf1a853","amp;dn":"The+Tale+of+Sweety+Barrett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b556604972671fc2368430cf1c0298fdf1a853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,181,86,96,73,114,103,31,194,54,132,48,207,28,2,152,253,241,168,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
