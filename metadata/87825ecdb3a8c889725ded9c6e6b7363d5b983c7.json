The prairies are the heartland of the continent, a vast, windswept plain that flows from Alberta south to Texas and from the Rockies east to the Mississippi River. This is big sky country, and until recently, one of the richest and most magnificent natural grasslands in the world. Today, however, the North American prairies are among the most altered environments on Earth. Thorough, detailed, and scientifically up-to-date, Prairie: A Natural History provides a comprehensive, nontechnical guide to the biology and ecology of this fabled environment, offering a view of the past, a vision for the future, and a clear focus on the present. Sidebars throughout highlight various grasslands species, tell fascinating natural history and conservation stories, and present the traditional Native American view of the prairie and its inhabitants","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87825ecdb3a8c889725ded9c6e6b7363d5b983c7","amp;dn":"Prairie-+A+Natural+History+by+Candace+Savage+%28retail+epub%2C+PDF%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87825ecdb3a8c889725ded9c6e6b7363d5b983c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,130,94,205,179,168,200,137,114,93,237,156,110,107,115,99,213,185,131,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
