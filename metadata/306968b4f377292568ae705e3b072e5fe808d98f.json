Give and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be given.\n\nI am a sort of refugee from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œminimalistic-was-a-starÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Many of my friends, my ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRegularsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ came on TPB following my torrents. It takes a long time not just to make people to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrecognizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ my small-sized stuff, but to adopt specific models of behaviour, when they interact, cooperate one with each other, exchange and, at the end, enjoy shows and movies. \n\nOne thing I have always repeated: Solidarity. We, people from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeveloped countriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ seem like have forgotten too easy what was only five-six years back when majority was on dial-up, wrestling with 2-4 kB/s. \n\nWe also forget how hard is to live far away from all cultural, sociological ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcushionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ our societies have provided for us, be surrounded with unbearable hardness of life, live surrounded by unimaginable poverty, diseases ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and a feeling of total disconnection from the rest of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshinyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ world, where obviously, no one cares about anything else but themselves. We, who have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ must share with the ones who have lessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Must. Other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtypesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of behaviour are not welcomed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ here. People who cannot share could go away, doors are open. Trespassers and punks will be escorted someplace else.\n\nWe are the rebels by nature, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why we are here on place called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPirate bayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ not to eat each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hearts out. We are here because world around is a dark place. People who come here are not the enemies, most of us struggle to survive, and taking just that and that much we need not to feel deprived by injustice. We are here to fight unrighteousness, but not amongst us. Never forget that.\n\nRead carefully how someoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kindess makes him a victim.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;htctouch at 2010-01-13 06:07 CET: \n\ncurrent stat:-\nThe.Road.DVDSCR.PROPER.H264.5273760.TPB\ndownload:- 109mb , uploaded:- 543mb\n\nwill do smokin aces nw wow wt a share man.waiting for more movie frm my bro2040\ncheers .. keep rocking .. \n\n&gt; twentyforty at 2010-01-13 06:35 CET: \n\n@htctouch: I bow to your kindness, but, my brother, this is too much, Your ratio should be 1:1 or slightly above, but that looks really sad, seeing you as victim. OK, LIMIT your upload speed, in ALL similar cases.\n\nDuring the download your ratio should be max. 0.5-0.6. Rest you make later, when you are at 100% - staying as seeder. If you stay to seed some unpopular torrent, IF no one pops-up for 48h you can stop the seeding and remove the torrent. \n\nIf you find the content valuable (some rare movie or show) you can stay as seeder as long as you can, to give others opportunity to find and download something. \n\n&gt;htctouch at 2010-01-13 06:48 CET: \n\nwhat had happen was ..\ni had to download some hindi movies at night and also ur release the road .. so the downloadin speed got distributed .. but i limit d hindi movies upload speed n made ur torrent unlimited upload [as i promised sir]\nnow m done with other movies n nw waiting only for ur releases[movies]\nryt nw m only downloading smokin aces2 n the road [unlimitd upload]ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONCLUSION:\nAfter someone has done this to htctouch (who struggles with 10 kB/s upload AND download speeds ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ because that is what he has and he gives to others) expect zero tolerance from me. I was awake the whole last night trying to catch up/nullify TPBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 38h downtimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see this. \n\nIf I did, down-time would be much longer, and not caused by TPB. \n\nAlso, in the future, if I spot something like that, kind of gang-banging of innocents, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll feel my response, I promise. If you are not satisfied with things IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve just said, please ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ go away. Internet is a Big place for all of us. And donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come back. Please.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:306968b4f377292568ae705e3b072e5fe808d98f","amp;dn":"The.Good.Wife.S01E12.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"306968b4f377292568ae705e3b072e5fe808d98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,105,104,180,243,119,41,37,104,174,112,94,59,7,46,95,232,8,217,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
