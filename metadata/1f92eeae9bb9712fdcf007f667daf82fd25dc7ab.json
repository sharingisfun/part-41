Did you grow up listening to Gravity Kills or Stabbing Westward and would like to hear more bands in that vein but are disappointed with current &quot;mainstream&quot; record label output?\n\nI highly recommend Pound of Flesh to you. It's the perfect combination of raw intensity mixed with excellent industrial production values. If this CD came out in the 90s, I could easily see there being a bidding war to get them on Modern Rock radio.\n\nDescription from","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f92eeae9bb9712fdcf007f667daf82fd25dc7ab","amp;dn":"Pound+Of+Flesh+-+Pill+%5B2012%5D%5Bmp3-320%5D_infx222","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f92eeae9bb9712fdcf007f667daf82fd25dc7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,146,238,174,155,185,113,47,220,240,7,246,103,218,248,47,210,93,199,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
