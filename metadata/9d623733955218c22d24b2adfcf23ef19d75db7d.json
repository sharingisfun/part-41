It's a collection of some of the best free\njazz improvisors from the US and Europe. Here is the band : Paul Dunmall, tenor\nsaxophone; Philip Gibbs, guitar; Roy Campbell, trumpet, flute; Daniel Carter,\nalto saxophone, trumpet, flute; Paul Rogers, 7-string bass; William Parker,\nbass, shenai; Hamid Drake, drums. So, in sum, it's Other Dimensions In Music\nfrom the US, meets the Dunmall/Gibbs/Rogers trio from the UK, in essence two\ntotally different bands with each their own style and approach. Other\nDimensions In Music usually brings slow contemplative pure free jazz\nimprovization, but with an exceptionally deep emotional\ncomponent. Dunmall/Gibbs/Rogers are more &quot;European&quot;, closer to free improv than\nfree jazz at times. But with two such bands you can expect anything, with\nthings potentially moving either way : total chaos because the mix doesn't\ntake, or a great success. And it is the latter. Mainly because of the concept\nof the album. On the first CD, only 1 of the 6 tracks is played by the full two\nbands, but even if that is the case, this is not a blowing session, but rather\na focused and respectful interaction, at times even offering an chamber-jazz\nfeel, sensitive and elegant. The second CD brings the fourty-minute title track\n&quot;Blown Away&quot;. And whatever the line-up, the music is great. Parker and Rogers\nseem to enjoy the interplay the most, having fun alternating arco and pizzi. On\n&quot;Eye Miles&quot; the whole band slows down for the two basses to play a duet, on the\nfollowing track &quot;Eel Miles&quot;, the basses circle around each other, tentatively,\nhesitantly, with Phil Gibbs' guitar adding shadows of sound, colors of\nintensity, sounding as deep and low-toned as the basses. On &quot;Franticle&quot;,\nDunmall plays for a change with the best rhythm section in the world, and you\ncannot but admire how both Parker and Drake together respond to Dunmall's\ngreat, but idiosyncratic tenor-playing. He can be a fierce and even violent\nblower, but not here, quite the contrary; his warm tone and creative style are\nall his own, regardless of the power he pushes out of his lungs. In that sense,\nthe next track, &quot;Sparticle&quot;, with Roy Campbell, Phil Gibbs and William Parker,\ncontinues in the same vein : great free soloing with a solid yet equally free\nbass and guitar rumbling in the background. What a pleasure to hear such great\nmusicians at work. In the next piece, a slow and intimate free ballad (if that\nexists), Rogers and Drake are the rhythm section, first with Campbell on flute\nand Carter on trumpet, then later with the two trumpets until Carter picks up\nhis sax. The subdued high intensity playing continues on the second disc, with\nwonderful interaction and alternation between the musicians, and it's\nabsolutely rare that they're all playing together, it's rather a band of\nmusicians selecting a short time sparring partner, or just doing a solo dance,\nor with two or three, then one of those goes on with someone else, just blowing\naway, free and unencumbered, ready for anything, open to initiatives and\nsurprises. About halfway, the controlled and restrained tense calmness erupts\ninto a total frenetic agony of all musicians playing together, with Parker's\nchenai competing in sound with Dunmall absent bagpipes, indeed just &quot;blowing\naway&quot;, but not for long, because once they establish a common focus, the music\nbecomes astonishingly beautiful, with Campbell playing a sad and melancholy\nsolo to make Chet Baker jealous, and Rogers' 7-string bass comment is even more\nimpressive, mixing in a more classical element, but then we move back into more\nexperimental formats, equally strong, with Dunmall bringing the music back to a\nclose harmony for a single tone of restrained tension. And I think that's the\nmajor achievement of this double-CD : all musicians without exception are\nmasters of their instrument, but also of music itself, creating more than 100\nminutes of emotional tension and surprises, creating something new, creating a\nnew listening experience. Highly recommended.\n\nWhy does such music remain unnoticed?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d623733955218c22d24b2adfcf23ef19d75db7d","amp;dn":"Philip+Gibbs%2C+Roy+Campbell%2C+Paul+Dunmall...+-+Blown+Away+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d623733955218c22d24b2adfcf23ef19d75db7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,98,55,51,149,82,24,194,45,36,178,173,252,242,62,241,157,117,219,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
