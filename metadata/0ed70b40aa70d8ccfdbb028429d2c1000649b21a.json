In the third and final movie, &quot;A Land Forever&quot;, Asparuh leads his people into the lands of modern Bulgaria, where he forms an alliance with the local Slavic tribes against the common threat of the medieval Roman Empire (Byzantium). What follows is one of the most massive clashes in the history of cinema, with more than 50 000 men from the Bulgarian army of 1981, serving as extras for the Roman and Bulgarian armies during the Battle of the Onglos.\r\n\r\nOriginal title: Ð¥Ð°Ð½ ÐÑÐ¿Ð°Ñ€ÑƒÑ… - Ð—ÐµÐ¼Ñ Ð·Ð°Ð²Ð¸Ð½Ð°Ð³Ð¸\r\nGenre: Historical\r\nCountry: Bulgaria\r\nDuration: 02:02:02\r\nYear: 1981\r\nLanguage: Bulgarian\r\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed70b40aa70d8ccfdbb028429d2c1000649b21a","amp;dn":"Han+Asparuh+part+III+%281981%29+224p+DVDRip-Zamunda+%5BEN+sub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed70b40aa70d8ccfdbb028429d2c1000649b21a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,215,11,64,170,112,216,204,253,187,2,132,41,210,193,0,6,73,178,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
