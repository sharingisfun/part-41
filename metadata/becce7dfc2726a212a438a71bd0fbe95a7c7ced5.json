Remarkable plot, characters and location. For me the most memorable thing is probably the cinematography - England&amp;#039;s Lancashire plain is a bizarrely beautiful place of emptiness, and well known for being almost impossible to photograph.\n\nOnly misses out on five stars for being Difficult. File somewhere near Peter Greenaway and My Own Private Idaho.&quot;\n\nAnd......Amanda Plummer - worth all five stars alone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:becce7dfc2726a212a438a71bd0fbe95a7c7ced5","amp;dn":"Butterfly+Kiss+%28Lesbian+Roadmovie%2FHorror+-+UK+1995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"becce7dfc2726a212a438a71bd0fbe95a7c7ced5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,204,231,223,194,114,106,33,42,67,138,113,189,15,190,149,167,199,206,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
