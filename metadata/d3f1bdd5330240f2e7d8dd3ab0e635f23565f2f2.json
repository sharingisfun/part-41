Woods, Jr. offers the first critical analysis of the 2010 mid-term elections and answers the #1 question on conservativesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ minds: How do we roll back the liberal policies and big government programs that Obama/Pelosi/Reid rushed through Congress before the mid-terms? From getting rid of wasteful and inefficient federal agencies to abolishing the income tax to repealing health care reform and all of ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“greenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ policies, Woods outlines a bold plan for dramatically overhauling the government and restoring our Founding Fathers vision for America.\n\nAbout the Author:\nThomas E.
