The group had been unhappy with Elektra because they felt pressure from the company not to innovate, as they were beginning to do (and would eventually record on Wheatstraw Suite), and because they felt that Elektra was not doing enough to promote their records. The Dillards chose to record a strictly traditional album with Berline, a friend of the group, because they owed Elektra one more album. Rodney later stated, &quot;That wasn't a record made for anyone but the traditionals. We got completely hacked to pieces by them. So we said, 'Okay, screw you guys, we'll make an album, and we'll play it right up your ass!,' so we did.&quot;\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Byron Berline - fiddle\n    * Rodney Dillard - guitar\n    * Douglas Dillard - banjo\n    * Mitchell Jayne - bass\n    * Dean Webb - mandolin\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1.
