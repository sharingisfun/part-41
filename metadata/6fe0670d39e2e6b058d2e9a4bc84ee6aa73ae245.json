He seemed unbeatable. So the British decided to have him killed. The British opened their counter-attack with a series of special forces raids, the first ever operation by the newly formed SAS. Rommel was one of the targets. Michael Asher reveals how poor planning and incompetence in high places led to disaster in the desert-- and how fantastic bravery and brilliant improvisation enabled a handful of men to escape. Classic real life adventure, written by best-selling desert expert and novelist Michael Asher.\nGenre: History / Military\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe0670d39e2e6b058d2e9a4bc84ee6aa73ae245","amp;dn":"Get+Rommel+The+secret+British+mission+to+kill+Hitler%27s+greatest+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe0670d39e2e6b058d2e9a4bc84ee6aa73ae245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,224,103,13,57,226,230,176,88,210,233,164,188,132,238,106,167,58,226,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
