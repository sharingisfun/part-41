Released in 1988 following her maternity break, this album was a welcome follow-up to the disasterous &quot;Soul Kiss&quot;. On &quot;The Rumour&quot;, we are treated to a variety of sounds from the versatile ONJ. The title song, written by Elton John (who also supplied backing vocals), is pure, fluffy dance-pop; energetic and appealing. &quot;Love and Let Live&quot;, the first pop anthem to AIDS awareness, is haunting, while &quot;Let's Talk About Tomorrow&quot;, an awesome ode to conservation, is majestic. The best cut is &quot;Walk Through Fire&quot;, a triumphant example of the unlimited talents of ONJ. And the eclecticly giddy &quot;Tutta La Vita&quot; supplies the icing on this well-crafted, decidedly rock-influenced confection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71f83da4a5d06af2a4a9a01ce66ae91e153435e6","amp;dn":"Olivia+Newton-John+-+The+Rumour+320cbr+1988","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71f83da4a5d06af2a4a9a01ce66ae91e153435e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,248,61,164,165,208,106,242,164,169,160,28,230,106,233,30,21,52,53,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
