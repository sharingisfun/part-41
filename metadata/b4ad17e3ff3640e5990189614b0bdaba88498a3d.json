For years he toiled the honky tonks and bars while holding down a day job, and didn't record his first album until 20 years after his first single in 1964. But since he began recording, he's unleashed a series of classic Texas country tunes, starting with his signature piece, &quot;Rolling Stone From Texas,&quot; represented, as it should be, in two versions: one the polished album edition, the other a rawer live version from 1964, the year it appeared as a single. What they bookend is nothing less than a series of marvels, like &quot;The John Deere Tractor Song,&quot; a wonderful ode to farmers; a glorious version of &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; that shimmers, with Walser's soft yodel bumping it along; his own &quot;Hot Rod Mercury,&quot; car nostalgia in four honky tonk minutes; and a very strange version of &quot;Rose Marie,&quot; performed with the Kronos Quartet. There are tracks collected from soundtracks, compilation albums, and a couple of unreleased pieces, and they're all sung with the same easy grace that's Walser's trademark. He has a big voice (he's been called the Pavarotti of the plains), and while relaxed, there's sometimes a formality about it that harks back to the '30s and '40s, which suits songs like Felice Bryant's &quot;We Could You and I,&quot; as well as his own wonderful material, which has brought him deserved success. Walser deserves a greatest-hits set, and this collection serves him very well indeed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ad17e3ff3640e5990189614b0bdaba88498a3d","amp;dn":"Don+Walser+-+Dare+To+Dream%3A+The+Best+Of+Don+Walser+%5B2012%5D+%5BWEB%2FF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ad17e3ff3640e5990189614b0bdaba88498a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,173,23,227,255,54,64,229,153,1,137,97,75,11,218,186,136,73,138,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
