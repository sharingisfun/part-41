Since 1982, the LSO has been based in London's Barbican Centre., Richie Williams, Kitty Lux, Will Grove-White och Jonty Bankes (basukulele).\nThe LSO was founded in 1904 as an independent, self governing organisation, the first such orchestra in the UK. It played its first concert on 9 June of that year, with Hans Richter conducting. He remained principal conductor until 1911, when Edward Elgar took over for a year, leading six concerts as principal conductor.\nThe LSO became the first British orchestra to play overseas when it went to Paris in 1906, and the first to play in the United States, in 1912. The LSO was due to sail on the RMS Titanic for a concert in New York in April 1912 but fortunately had to change the booking at the last minute. Another kind of narrow escape occurred during the Great War; despite in its early years having attracted the world's greatest conductors, after 1914 it was subject to financial adversity and in 1917 suspended giving concerts altogether. When peace resumed, many of the former players were unavailable and so the training of a new team fell to the young Albert Coates; as a revitalised body, they gave their first concert in October 1919.\nIn 1956, the orchestra appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's film The Man Who Knew Too Much, conducted by composer Bernard Herrmann in the climactic scene, filmed in Royal Albert Hall.\nIn 1966, the London Symphony Chorus (LSC) was formed to complement the work of the LSO. With more than two hundred amateur singers, the LSC maintains a close association with the LSO; however it has developed an independent life, which allows it to partner other leading orchestras.\nIn 1973 it was the first British orchestra to be invited to take part in the Salzburg Festival. It continues to make tours around the world\n\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a793a3860e83dcc95e9e094f61e5a3828860cdfd","amp;dn":"The+London+Symphony+Orchestra-Classic+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a793a3860e83dcc95e9e094f61e5a3828860cdfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,147,163,134,14,131,220,201,94,158,9,79,97,229,163,130,136,96,205,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
