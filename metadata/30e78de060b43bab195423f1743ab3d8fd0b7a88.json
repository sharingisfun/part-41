A modernized adaptation of Alphonse Daudet's Sappho, the film casts Garbo as Yvonne, a Parisian belle with &quot;a history.&quot; When her past returns to haunt her, she decides to walk out on her sweetheart Andre (Robert Montgomery), even though she still loves him. Eventually she returns to Andre, but this time he leaves her. Worried that Yvonne will take drastic action over his defection, Andre returns, whereupon Yvonne breaks up the romance a third time, &quot;all for the best.&quot; Had there been a fourth breakup, the audience probably would have walked out. No matter: Garbo illuminates every scene she's in, and that's all anyone could possibly ask for.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022001/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022001/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nClarence Brown\n\n        Greta Garbo\t ... \tYvonne Valbret\n\n\tRobert Montgomery\t... \tAndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Montell\n\tLewis Stone\t... \tRaymond Delval\n\tMarjorie Rambeau\t... \tLulu\n\tJudith Vosselli\t... \tOdette\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:15:49\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 560x416\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 30,00\nBitRate : 1349 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30e78de060b43bab195423f1743ab3d8fd0b7a88","amp;dn":"Inspiration+%281931%29+Greta+Garbo%2CRobert+Montgomery.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30e78de060b43bab195423f1743ab3d8fd0b7a88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,231,141,224,96,180,59,171,25,84,35,241,116,58,179,216,253,11,122,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
