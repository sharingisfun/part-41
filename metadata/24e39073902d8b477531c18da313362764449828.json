He gets into a &quot;racially charged incident&quot; with Bruce Levinson, announces that Jon Stewart will be getting his ass waxed by Bailey Jay on Thursday's show, and then addresses some &quot;white crimes&quot; in the news. We do some reminiscing about Ant's old broadcasting days, discuss the Ray Rice elevator video, and look at a bunch of the gadgets people use to smoke pot with these days. He ends today with an obvious hate crime caught on video and the lack of outrage surrounding it, talks to a few more yammering callers, and treats us to an incredible concert of sorts thanks to a video. Priceless.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24e39073902d8b477531c18da313362764449828","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-08+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24e39073902d8b477531c18da313362764449828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,227,144,115,144,45,139,71,117,49,193,141,163,19,54,39,100,68,152,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
