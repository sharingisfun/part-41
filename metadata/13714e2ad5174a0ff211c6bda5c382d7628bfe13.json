For the time being, all he asked for was to be happy, and to grow a bit taller. Even though she was older than Pup, Dolly was always in awe of her brother. More and more, she wanted to believe that he had occult powers and could do anything. Magic could remove the birthmark from her face and make her normal. Magic could kill their wicked stepmother, Myra. Pup laughs when Dolly shows him an effigy of Myra: a rag doll, about fifteen inches high, with knitted nylon skin and rust-coloured wool hair. Dolly sticks it full of pins. Myra dies. With dazzling virtuosity Ruth Rendell explores a haunted world of obsession, delusions and murderous fantasy....\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13714e2ad5174a0ff211c6bda5c382d7628bfe13","amp;dn":"Killing+Doll+-+Ruth+Rendell++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13714e2ad5174a0ff211c6bda5c382d7628bfe13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,113,78,42,213,23,74,15,242,17,198,189,165,195,130,215,98,139,254,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
