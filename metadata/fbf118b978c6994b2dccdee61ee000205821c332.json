Norman returns to his motel and the old Victorian mansion where his troubles started, and history predictably begins to repeat itself.\n\n-----------\n\nHalloween's near and I was looking for a widescreen download of Psycho 2 just to have. Well I couldn't find one. So I ripped my own movie and copied it for everyone to enjoy. I think I'll be sharing them all.\n\n----Video----\nAspect Ratio: 1.85:1\nCodec: XviD\nResolution: 640x352\nFrame Rate: 23.976\nRegion 1 (NTSC)\n\n----Audio----\nCodec: MP3 VBR\nLanguage: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbf118b978c6994b2dccdee61ee000205821c332","amp;dn":"PSYCHO.II.1983.DVDRip.WS.XviD-Sporc.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbf118b978c6994b2dccdee61ee000205821c332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,241,24,185,120,198,153,75,45,204,222,230,30,224,0,32,88,33,195,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
