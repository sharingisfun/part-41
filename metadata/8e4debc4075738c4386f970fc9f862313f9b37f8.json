Prayer (10:50)\n\nThis is unlike any other release by an English band normally rooted in the blues. Think of it as Spooky Tooth's version of Concerto for Group and Orchestra by Deep Purple. After two or three promising blues-based rock releases, one member of the band somehow convinces the others to go for a wildly ambitious, experimental concept album. Jon Lord persuaded Deep Purple to dive into the deep end, and Gary Wright got Spooky Tooth to welcome Frenchman Pierre Henry for this electronic mass. Wright left the band after Ceremony and Lord never had the same influence on Purple again as Ritchie Blackmore led them to heavy metal glory.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e4debc4075738c4386f970fc9f862313f9b37f8","amp;dn":"Pierre+Henry+and+Spooky+Tooth+-+Ceremony+%5B1969%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e4debc4075738c4386f970fc9f862313f9b37f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,77,235,196,7,87,56,196,56,111,151,15,201,248,98,49,63,155,55,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
