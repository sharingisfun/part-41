It is\ntransliterated into Greek letters rather than translated, and is found at the\nend of Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor 16:22) as a farewell.\n\n&quot;If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.&quot;\n\nThe word 'Maranatha' translates to &quot;O Lord, come!&quot;, however if separated into\n'Maran atha', it becomes a credal declaration of &quot;Our Lord has come.&quot;\n\nArioch played all instruments on this album except for the drums which are done\nby a unknown session drummer. The album has been recorded in the Endarker Studio in 2008.
