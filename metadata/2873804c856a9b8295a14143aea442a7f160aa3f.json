They\nput on an awesome show, then I met them at the end of the gig, proper\nnice guys. Picked up a signed copy of their album, which I suggest\ny'all do.\n\n\n\nHailing from Brighton, The Crave are a young rock band with grand\nambitions. They have spent the last few years notching up invaluable\ntouring experience throughout Europe and the US. They also have\nDownload, Sonisphere and Rock Am festival dates under their belts and a\nhost of big name support slots. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be liar if I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t impressed with\ntheir touring rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© so far, but it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t automatically mean theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll\nproduce a decent album. Fortunately for them and me they have produced\na well polished and highly accomplished album in Breaking the Silence.\n\nReading the track listing I was concerned that I was in for 50 mins of\nwhining and bleeding hearts (synical moi?) but I was pleasantly\nsurprised. The Crave demonstrate a clear understanding of their target\naudience and this album is full of radio friendly rock anthems. The\nlads are all clearly skilled musicians and the songs themselves are\ndripping with guitar riffs and vocal hooks of a quality that many more\nexperienced bands struggle to achieve. A lead guitar tone borrowed from\nSlash is also reassuring and very welcome on the ears.\n\nAlbum opener Cooking in the Kitchen is typical of The CraveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound and\nsits somewhere between Feeder and Velvet Revolver.  Something Beautiful\nreminds me of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley Cr?e and KISS with some nice anthemic vocals to\nengage the audience. Title track Breaking the Silence sounds like the\nsort of tune used on the soundtrack to an American teen movie. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all\ngood stuff.\n\nA well produced album, slower, more stripped back tunes Surrender &amp;\nRetreat and Weight of the World add a nice balance across the 13\ntracks. There are also slow burners such as Silently Screaming which\nreally kicks in after a couple of minutes of building. I can imagine\nthis being a great tune to see and hear live.\n\nAll Of You drops in some more aggressive Mark Tremonti style riffing\nwhich I admit makes me sit up and take extra notice but the momentum of\nthat riff doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t carry through the song quite the way I would\npersonally like.\n\nGiven time and the right promotion, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no reason that we wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be\nseeing and hearing more of The Crave in the future. Their tunes sit\nnicely in the rock radio category. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see them struggling to pick\nup lots more fans given the right exposure. If this sounds like your\ncup of tea, I encourage you to check them out and grab a copy of\nBreaking the Silence.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thecrave.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thecrave.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2873804c856a9b8295a14143aea442a7f160aa3f","amp;dn":"The_Crave-Breaking_The_Silence-2011-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2873804c856a9b8295a14143aea442a7f160aa3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,115,128,76,133,106,155,130,149,161,65,67,174,164,66,167,241,96,170,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
