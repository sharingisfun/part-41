It is made by snagglepop.com and it is our first release. This is version .02a and it is playable, though incomplete. It is being distributed for feedback. The game is called Poverty. It is an RPG in an 80's style and though the storyline is almost non-existant at this point it deals with modern themes in a fantasy setting.\n\nYou play Oscar, a guy with a girlfriend problem who got caught cheating with a stripper. Now she's dead and someone is trying to frame him for murder.\n\nTo install simply double click the .exe file. This will create a folder that has a game launcher in it. Visit our website at snagglepop.com if you have any questions, difficulties, or want to see screenshots.\n\nThanks,\n     Snagglepop.com\n\nP.S.
