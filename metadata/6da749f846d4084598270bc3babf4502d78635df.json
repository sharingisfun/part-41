Orion`s Bastards, led by the monstrous Buster, have put the once-quaint town under their boots, and they`re not rolling out the welcome wagon. But Susan bears the mark of the Devil, and when the Bastards take the only thing she holds dear, there`ll be Hell to pay. Homecoming is a critical narrative link between Grendel: War Child and the upcoming Grendel illustrated novel by Greg Rucka and Matt Wagner","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6da749f846d4084598270bc3babf4502d78635df","amp;dn":"Grendel+Tales+-+Homecoming+%28Dark+Horse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6da749f846d4084598270bc3babf4502d78635df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,167,73,248,70,212,8,69,152,39,11,195,186,191,69,2,215,134,53,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
