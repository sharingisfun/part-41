Sweeping yet precise, moving from essential detail to bracing illustration, Steiner spans the entire history of philosophy in the West as it entwines with literature, finding that, as Sartre stated, in all philosophy there is a hidden literary prose.\n\nThe poetic genius of abstract thought, Steiner believes, is lit, is made audible. Argument, even analytic, has its drumbeat. It is made ode. What voices the closing movements of Hegels Phenomenology better than Edith Piafs non de non, a twofold negation which Hegel would have prized? This essay is an attempt to listen more closely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d676e1f1bce1a359ead4829fc2983af79435fa13","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+of+Thought+-+George+Steiner.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d676e1f1bce1a359ead4829fc2983af79435fa13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,118,225,241,188,225,163,89,234,212,130,159,194,152,58,247,148,53,250,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
