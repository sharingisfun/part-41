The album was produced by Nathan Joseph and Bill Leader, although Leader was left uncredited.[1]\nThe album features nine songs composed by Jansch, one by Alex Campbell (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo Long (Been on the Road So Long)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and the traditional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ900 MilesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. For this last Jansch accompanies himself on the banjo rather than the steel-string acoustic guitar which he uses elsewhere. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy LoverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has John Renbourn playing the lead acoustic guitar part, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLucky ThirteenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a guitar duet with Renbourn, based on a song written by the latter and apparently recorded during the Bert And John session.[2] Finally, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTinkers BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe WheelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are guitar instrumentals composed and performed by Jansch.\n[edit]Track listing\n\n&quot;Oh, My Babe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n&quot;Ring-a-Ding Bird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n&quot;Tinker's Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:04\n&quot;Anti Apartheid&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n&quot;The Wheel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:45\n&quot;A Man I'd Rather Be&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04\n&quot;My Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n&quot;It Don't Bother Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n&quot;Harvest Your Thoughts of Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:12\n&quot;Lucky Thirteen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30 (composed by John Renbourn)\n&quot;As the Day Grows Longer Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n&quot;So Long (Been on the Road So Long)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n&quot;Want My Daddy Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:33\n&quot;900 Miles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03\n\nReleased\tDecember 1965\nRecorded\tc.
