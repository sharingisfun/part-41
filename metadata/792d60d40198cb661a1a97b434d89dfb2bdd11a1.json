It is recordings of all the unlockable songs in the game.\n\nI have added fade outs to the endings of most of the songs, since they are designed to repeat, there isnt really any other way to naturally end them. \n\nThe shorter songs repeat a few times so that each song is at least a minute long. All the songs are between one and three minutes.\n\nLastly, all the songs are in FLAC format, because it sounds so much better than mp3. If you really need to downgrade them, you can use the certified non-virus winamp or try your luck with one of the many other programs.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792d60d40198cb661a1a97b434d89dfb2bdd11a1","amp;dn":"Kirbys+Epic+Yarn+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792d60d40198cb661a1a97b434d89dfb2bdd11a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,45,96,212,1,152,203,102,26,26,151,180,52,216,157,251,43,221,17,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
