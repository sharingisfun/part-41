No matter how many times I downloaded the CD versions I found that I always had to manually install the progs from CD2 - whether I'd burned from BIN/CUE or from ISO, or even mounted with Daemon Tools - When asked for CD2 nothing happened! so I re-authored the CD's into a DVD using Adobe's original autorun etc - works fine! Serial and PS activation are in the image - enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b93637a3878d9d7f5daf5de5c0c112a90553246b","amp;dn":"Adobe+Creative+Suite","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b93637a3878d9d7f5daf5de5c0c112a90553246b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,54,55,163,135,141,157,127,93,175,93,229,192,193,18,169,5,83,36,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
